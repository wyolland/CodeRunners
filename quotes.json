But there was always some obstacle in the way, something to be gotten through first, some unfinished business, time still to be served, a debt to be paid. At last it dawned on me that these obstacles were my life. This perspective has helped me to see there is no way to happiness. Happiness is the way.

Stop apologizing all the time. Learn to say no, so your yes has some oomph. Spend time with the friends who lift you up, and cut loose the ones who bring you down. Stop giving your power away.

Men do not really live for honors or for pay; their gladness is not the taking and holding, but in doing, the striving, the building, the living. It is a higher joy to teach than to be taught.

Whether we have it all or we have nothing, we are all faced with the same obstacles: sadness, loss, illness, dying and death.

Then you can enjoy a lifelong love affair that brings you the richest fulfillment from inside out."},
{"text": "Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, 'Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?' Actually, who are you not to be?"},
{"text": "To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."},
{"text": "Until we have seen someone's darkness, we don't really know who they are. Until we have forgiven someone's darkness, we don't really know what love is."},
{"text": "Before you can live a part of you has to die. You have to let go of what could have been, how you should have acted and what you wish you would have said differently. You have to accept that you can\u2019t change the past experiences, opinions of others at that moment in time or outcomes from their choices or yours. When you finally recognize that truth, then you will understand the true meaning of forgiveness of yourself and others. From this point you will finally be free."},
{"text": "To forgive is the highest, most beautiful form of love. In return, you will receive untold peace and happiness."},

{"text": "To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all."},
{"text": "Live with intention. Walk to the edge. Listen Hard. Practice wellness. Play with abandon. Laugh. Choose with no regrets. Appreciate your friends. Continue to learn. Do what you love. Live as if this is all there is."},
{"text": "Happiness is a journey, not a destination. For a long time it seemed to me that life was about to begin\u2014real life. But there was always some obstacle in the way, something to be gotten through first, some unfinished business, time still to be served, a debt to be paid. At last it dawned on me that these obstacles were my life. This perspective has helped me to see there is no way to happiness. Happiness is the way. So treasure every moment you have and remember that time waits for no one."},

{"text": "You cannot discover new oceans unless you have the courage to lose sight of the shore."},

Think only of the best, work only for the best, and expect only the best. Forget the mistakes of the past and press on to the greater achievements of the future. Give so much time to the improvement of yourself that you have no time to criticize others. Live in the faith that the whole world is on your side so long as you are true to the best that is in you!"},
{"text": "When it is dark enough, you can see the stars."},
{"text": "I am fundamentally an optimist. Whether that comes from nature or nurture, I cannot say. Part of being optimistic is keeping one's head pointed toward the sun, one's feet moving forward. There were many dark moments when my faith in humanity was sorely tested, but I would not and could not give myself up to despair. That way lays defeat and death."},
{"text": "Honesty is the best policy. If I lose mine honor, I lose myself."},

{"text": "Three things cannot be long hidden: the sun, the moon, and the truth."},
{"text": "We have to stand up for what we believe in, even when we might not be popular for it. Honesty starts with being ourselves, authentic and true to who we are and what we believe in, and that may not always be popular, but it will always let you follow your dreams and your heart."},
{"text": "Honesty is more than not lying. It is truth telling, truth speaking, truth living, and truth loving."},

{"text": "Character may be manifested in the great moments, but it is made in the small ones."},
{"text": "Strength of a character isn't always about how much you can handle before you break. It\u2019s also about how much you can handle after you've been broken."},
{"text": "Good character is more to be praised than outstanding talent. Most talents are to some extent a gift. Good character, by contrast, is not given to us. We have to build it piece by piece by thought, choice, courage and determination."},
{"text": "Character cannot be developed in ease and quiet. Only through experience of trial and suffering can the soul be strengthened, vision cleared, ambition inspired, and success achieved."},
{"text": "All that is gold does not glitter, not all those who wander are lost; The old that is strong does not wither, deep roots are not reached by the frost."},
{"text": "Then, one day, when you least expect it, the great adventure finds you."},
{"text": "Maybe the journey isn\u2019t so much about becoming anything. Maybe it\u2019s about un-becoming everything that isn\u2019t really you, so you can be who you were meant to be in the first place."},

{"text": "Never look down to test the ground before taking your next step; only he who keeps his eye fixed on the far horizon will find the right road."},
{"text": "Don't ever give up. Don't ever give in. Don't ever stop trying. Don't ever sell out. And if you find yourself succumbing to one of the above for a brief moment, pick yourself up, brush yourself off, whisper a prayer, and start where you left off. But never, ever, ever give up."},
{"text": "The real voyage of discovery consists of not in seeking new landscapes but in having new eyes."},

{"text": "Create the highest, grandest vision possible for your life, because you become what you believe."},
{"text": "The problems of the world cannot possibly be solved by skeptics or cynics whose horizons are limited by the obvious realities. We need men who can dream of things that never were and ask 'why not'?"},

{"text": "You can't use up creativity. The more you use, the more you have."},
{"text": "Creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes. Art is knowing which ones to keep."},
{"text": "Logic will get you from A to B. Imagination will take you everywhere."},
{"text": "To live a creative life, we must lose our fear of being wrong."},

{"text": "Do the things you used to talk about doing but never did. Know when to let go and when to hold on tight. Stop rushing. Don't be intimidated to say it like it is. Stop apologizing all the time. Learn to say no, so your yes has some oomph. Spend time with the friends who lift you up, and cut loose the ones who bring you down. Stop giving your power away. Be more concerned with being interested than being interesting. Be old enough to appreciate your freedom, and young enough to enjoy it. Finally, know who you are."},
{"text": "We can learn to see each other and see ourselves in each other and recognize that human beings are more alike than we are unalike."},
{"text": "It's easy to find reasons for division between people. Finding common ground is harder, but a step towards happiness."},

{"text": "How far you go in life depends on your being tender with the young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving and tolerant of the weak and strong. Because someday in your life you will have been all of these."},
{"text": "We find greatest joy, not in getting, but in expressing what we are. Men do not really live for honors or for pay; their gladness is not the taking and holding, but in doing, the striving, the building, the living. It is a higher joy to teach than to be taught. It is good to get justice, but better to do it; fun to have things but more to make them. The happy man is he who lives the life of love, not for the honors it may bring, but for the life itself."},
{"text": "Joy goes against the foundations of mathematics: it multiplies when we divide."},
{"text": "Comparison is the thief of joy."},
{"text": "Joy is the holy fire that keeps our purpose warm and our intelligence aglow."},

{"text": "If you shift your focus from yourself to others, extend your concern to others, and cultivate the thought of caring for the well being of others, then this will have the immediate effect of opening up your life and helping you to reach out."},
{"text": "Sometimes its not the strength but gentleness that cracks the hardest shells."},
{"text": "Excellence is the result of caring more than others think is wise, risking more than others think is safe, dreaming more than others think is practical, and expecting more than others think is possible."},
{"text": "Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word, a listening ear, an honest compliment, or the smallest act of caring, all of which have the potential to turn a life around."},
{"text": "Desire is the key to motivation, but it\u2019s determination and commitment to an unrelenting pursuit of your goal - a commitment to excellence - that will enable you to attain the success you seek."},
{"text": "Without commitment, you cannot have depth in anything, whether it's a relationship, a business or a hobby."},
{"text": "There's a difference between interest and commitment. When you're interested in doing something, you do it only when it's convenient. When you're committed to something, you accept no excuses - only results."},
{"text": "Freedom is not the absence of commitments, but the ability to choose - and commit myself to - what is best for me."},

{"text": "If I had to select one quality, one personal characteristic that I regard as being most highly correlated with success, whatever the field, I would pick the trait of persistence. Determination. The will to endure to the end, to get knocked down seventy times and get up off the floor saying, \u201dHere comes number seventy-one!\u201d"},
{"text": "Your opponent, in the end, is never really the player on the other side of the net, or the swimmer in the next lane, or the team on the other side of the field, or even the bar you must high-jump. Your opponent is yourself, your negative internal voices, your level of determination."},

{"text": "Be of good cheer. Do not think of today's failures, but of the success that may come tomorrow. You have set yourselves a difficult task, but you will succeed if you persevere; and you will find a joy in overcoming obstacles. Remember, no effort that we make to attain something beautiful is ever lost."},
{"text": "Change is not something that we should fear. Rather, it is something that we should welcome. For without change, nothing in this world would ever grow or blossom, and no one in this world would ever move forward to become the person they're meant to be."},
{"text": "Confront the dark parts of yourself, and work to banish them with illumination and forgiveness. Your willingness to wrestle with your demons will cause your angels to sing."},
{"text": "The most beautiful people we have known are those who have known defeat, known suffering, known struggle, known loss, and have found their way out of the depths. These persons have an appreciation, a sensitivity, and an understanding of life that fills them with compassion, gentleness, and a deep loving concern. Beautiful people do not just happen."},
{"text": "People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people who get on in this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and if they can't find them, make them."},
{"text": "He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how."},
{"text": "We don't beat the Grim Reaper by living longer, we beat the Reaper by living well and living fully, for the Reaper will come for all of us. The question is what do we do between the time we are born and the time he shows up."},
{"text": "That thing that you do, after your day job, in your free time, too early in the morning, too late at night. That thing you read about, write about, think about, in fact fantasize about. That thing you do when you\u2019re all alone and there\u2019s no one to impress, nothing to prove, no money to be made, simply a passion to pursue. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s your thing. That\u2019s your heart, your guide. That\u2019s the thing you must, must do."},
{"text": "The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why."},
{"text": "The purpose of life is not to be happy. It is to be useful, to be honorable, to be compassionate, to have it make some difference that you have lived and lived well."},
{"text": "Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen."},
{"text": "A ship is safe in harbor, but that's not what ships are for."},
{"text": "Courage doesn't always roar. Sometimes courage is the little voice at the end of the day that says I'll try again tomorrow."},
{"text": "Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage."},
{"text": "You gain strength, courage and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face. You are able to say to yourself, 'I have lived through this horror. I can take the next thing that comes along.' You must do the thing you think you cannot do."},
{"text": "Unity is strength... when there is teamwork and collaboration, wonderful things can be achieved."},

{"text": "Sometimes it is better to lose and do the right thing than to win and do the wrong thing."},
{"text": "Sportsmanship for me is when a guy walks off the court and you really can't tell whether he won or lost, when he carries himself with pride either way."},
{"text": "Be more concerned with your character than your reputation, because your character is what you really are, while your reputation is merely what others think you are."},
{"text": "Games give you a chance to excel, and if you're playing in good company you don't even mind if you lose because you had the enjoyment of the company during the course of the game."},
{"text": "Victory is remembered for at most two decades; an act of good sportsmanship is remembered for a lifetime."},
{"text": "I know you've heard it a thousand times before, but it's true... hard work pays off. If you want to be good, you have to practice, practice, practice. If you don't love something, then don't do it."},
{"text": "To practice five things under all circumstances constitutes perfect virtue; these five are gravity, generosity of soul, sincerity, earnestness, and kindness."},
{"text": "An ounce of practice is generally worth more than a ton of theory."},
{"text": "It is a mistake to think that the practice of my art has become easy to me. I assure you, dear friend, no one has given so much care to the study of composition as I. There is scarcely a famous master in music whose works I have not frequently and diligently studied."},

{"text": "The earth will not continue to offer its harvest, except with faithful stewardship. We cannot say we love the land and then take steps to destroy it for use by future generations."},
{"text": "Live in each season as it passes; breathe the air, drink the drink, taste the fruit, and resign yourself to the influence of the earth."},
{"text": "The earth has music for those who listen."},
{"text": "Forget not that the earth delights to feel your bare feet and the winds long to play with your hair."},
{"text": "Climb the mountains and get their good tidings. Nature's peace will flow into you as sunshine flows into trees. The winds will blow their own freshness into you, and the storms their energy, while cares will drop away from you like the leaves of Autumn."},
{"text": "You must take personal responsibility. You cannot change the circumstances, the seasons, or the wind, but you can change yourself. That is something you have charge of."},
{"text": "Find joy in everything you choose to do. Every job, relationship, home... it's your responsibility to love it, or change it."},
{"text": "The best day of your life is the one on which you decide your life is your own. No apologies or excuses. No one to lean on, rely on, or blame. The gift is yours - it is an amazing journey - and you alone are responsible for the quality of it. This is the day your life really begins."},
{"text": "The final forming of a person's character lies in their own hands."},
{"text": "Accept responsibility for your life. Know that it is you who will get you where you want to go, no one else."},
{"text": "The wise do not buy into other people\u2019s perceptions of who they are and what they are capable of. Instead, they bypass a person\u2019s public persona and see who they are in their highest expression. When you see actions taken with integrity, instead of words only, you will then know a soul\u2019s worth."},
{"text": "People are like stained-glass windows. They sparkle and shine when the sun is out, but when the darkness sets in, their true beauty is revealed only if there is a light from within."},
{"text": "Beauty is not in the face; beauty is a light in the heart."},
{"text": "True beauty is not related to what color your hair is or what color your eyes are. True beauty is about who you are as a human being, your principles, your moral compass."},
{"text": "The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched - they must be felt with the heart."},
{"text": "Service is a smile.  It is an acknowledging wave, a reaching handshake, a friendly wink, and a warm hug.   It's these simple acts that matter most, because the greatest service to a human soul has always been the kindness of recognition."},
{"text": "Love is not patronizing and charity isn't about pity, it is about love. Charity and love are the same\u2014with charity you give love, so don't just give money but reach out your hand instead."},
{"text": "While we do our good works let us not forget that the real solution lies in a world in which charity will have become unnecessary."},
{"text": "When we give cheerfully and accept gratefully, everyone is blessed."},
{"text": "We cannot seek achievement for ourselves and forget about progress and prosperity for our community...Our ambitions must be broad enough to include the aspirations and needs of others, for their sakes and for our own."},
{"text": "The miracle is this: the more we share the more we have."},
{"text": "When we honestly ask ourselves which person in our lives means the most to us, we often find that it is those who, instead of giving advice, solutions, or cures, have chosen rather to share our pain and touch our wounds with a warm and tender hand."},
{"text": "When someone steals another's clothes, we call them a thief. Should we not give the same name to one who could clothe the naked and does not? The bread in your cupboard belongs to the hungry; the coat unused in your closet belongs to the one who needs it; the shoes rotting in your closet belong to the one who has no shoes; the money which you hoard up belongs to the poor."},
{"text": "Love only grows by sharing. You can only have more for yourself by giving it away to others."},
{"text": "Go into the world and do well. But more importantly, go into the world and do good."},
{"text": "You cannot hope to build a better world without improving the individuals. To that end, each of us must work for our own improvement and, at the same time, share a general responsibility for all humanity, our particular duty being to aid those to whom we think we can be most useful."},
{"text": "Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it\u2019s the only thing that ever has."},
{"text": "Everybody can be great.  Because anybody can serve.  You don't have to have a college degree to serve.  You don't have to make your subject and your verb agree to serve.... You don't have to know the second theory of thermodynamics in physics to serve.  You only need a heart full of grace.  A soul generated by love."},
{"text": "I am only one, but I am one.  I cannot do everything, but I can do something.  And I will not let what I cannot do interfere with what I can do."},
{"text": "Gracious acceptance is an art\u2014an art which most never bother to cultivate. We think that we have to learn how to give, but we forget about accepting things, which can be much harder than giving... Accepting another person's gift is allowing him to express his feelings for you."},
{"text": "For it is in giving that we receive."},
{"text": "We make a living by what we get. We make a life by what we give."},
{"text": "The greatest good you can do for another is not just share your riches, but to reveal to him his own."},

{"text": "There is no exercise better for the heart than reaching down and lifting people up."},

{"text": "Fear grows out of the things we think; it lives in our minds. Compassion grows out of the things we are, and lives in our hearts."},
{"text": "The simple path: silence is prayer, prayer is faith, faith is love, love is service, the fruit of service is peace."},
{"text": "When I say it's you I like, I'm talking about that part of you that knows that life is far more than anything you can ever see or hear or touch. That deep part of you that allows you to stand for those things without which humankind cannot survive. Love that conquers hate, peace that rises triumphant over war, and justice that proves more powerful than greed."},
{"text": "Peace cannot be kept by force; it can only be achieved by understanding."},
{"text": "Peace comes from within. Do not seek it without."},
{"text": "Peace. It does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise, trouble or hard work. It means to be in the midst of those things and still be calm in your heart."},

{"text": "There are those whose lives affect all others around them. Quietly touching one heart, who in turn, touches another. Reaching out to ends further than they would ever know."},
{"text": "All things are bound together. All things connect. Whatever happens to the Earth happens to the children of the Earth. Man did not weave the web of life, he is merely a strand in it. Whatever he does to the web, he does to himself."},
{"text": "Life is short and we have never too much time for gladdening the hearts of those who are traveling the dark journey with us. Oh be swift to love, make haste to be kind."},
{"text": "Nobody has ever measured, not even poets, how much the heart can hold."},
{"text": "Remember when you go into the world to keep your eyes and ears wide open. And be kind. Love one another. Take care of each other. Tell the truth. Always do your best. Listen to the big people and the little people. Explore new paths and have fun. Know that you are loved like crazy. Give thanks for all your blessings. Above all else, Love and you will do wonderful things in this world."},

{"text": "We all have our own life to pursue, our own kind of dream to be weaving, and we all have the power to make wishes come true, as long as we keep believing."},
{"text": "Believe deep down in your heart that you're destined to do great things."},
{"text": "And above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. Those who don't believe in magic will never find it."},

{"text": "A constructive, useful life, good works, and good relationships are as valid as writing poetry or inventing a machine.

People do notice, people appreciate. I appreciate it when it\u2019s done to (for) me. Small gestures can be an effort, or actually go against our grain (\u201cI\u2019m not a big one for paying compliments\u2026\u201d), but the irony is that almost every time you make them, you feel better about yourself.

{"text": "To be rich in admiration and free from envy, to rejoice greatly in the good of others, to love with such generosity of heart that your love is still a dear possession in absence or unkindness - these are the gifts which money cannot buy."},
{"text": "Rather than admit a mistake, nations have gone to war, families have separated, and good people have sacrificed everything dear to them. Admitting that you were wrong is just another way of saying that you are wiser today than yesterday."},
{"text": "Faith is daring to put your dream to the test. It is better to try to do something and fail than to try to do nothing and succeed."},
{"text": "Set your course by the stars, not by the lights of every passing ship."},
{"text": "The exercise of power is determined by thousands of interactions between the world of the powerful and that of the powerless, all the more so because these worlds are never divided by a sharp line: everyone has a small part of himself in both."},
{"text": "Take a stand for what's right. Raise a ruckus and make a change. You may not always be popular, but you'll be part of something larger and bigger and greater than yourself. Besides, making history is extremely cool."},
{"text": "People of mediocre ability sometimes achieve outstanding success because they don't know when to quit. Most men succeed because they are determined to."},
{"text": "Wealth consists not in having great possessions, but in having few wants."},
{"text": "Learning to let go should be learned before learning to get. Life should be touched, not strangled. You\u2019ve got to relax, let it happen at times, and at others move forward with it."},
{"text": "Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something - your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life."},
{"text": "If you can't figure out your purpose, figure out your passion. For your passion will lead you right into your purpose."},

{"text": "A pessimist is one who makes difficulties of his opportunities and an optimist is one who makes opportunities of his difficulties."},
{"text": "Human progress is neither automatic nor inevitable... Every step toward the goal of justice requires sacrifice, suffering, and struggle; the tireless exertions and passionate concern of dedicated individuals."},
{"text": "The single greatest lesson the garden teaches is that our relationship to the planet need not be zero-sum, and that as long as the sun still shines and people still can plan and plant, think and do, we can, if we bother to try, find ways to provide for ourselves without diminishing the world.

{"text": "Be fearless. Have the courage to take risks. Go where there are no guarantees. Get out of your comfort zone even if it means being uncomfortable. The road less traveled is sometimes fraught with barricades bumps and uncharted terrain. But it is on that road where your character is truly tested. And have the courage to accept that you\u2019re not perfect nothing is and no one is \u2014 and that\u2019s OK."},

{"text": "Genius is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration."},
{"text": "You can search throughout the entire universe for someone who is more deserving of your love and affection than you are yourself, and that person is not to be found anywhere. You, yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe, deserve your love and affection."},

Evolution and all hopes for a better world rest in the fearlessness and open-hearted vision of people who embrace life."},
