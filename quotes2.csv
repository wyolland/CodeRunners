Do one thing every day that scares you.

We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be.


Sometimes you wake up. Sometimes the fall kills you. And sometimes, when you fall, you fly.


When we love, we always strive to become better than we are. When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better too.


Hold fast to dreams,

What's meant to be will always find a way


The flower that blooms in adversity is the rarest and most beautiful of all.


If you're reading this...

We delight in the beauty of the butterfly, but rarely admit the changes it has gone through to achieve that beauty.


You never have to change anything you got up in the middle of the night to write.


The unexamined life is not worth living.


Courage is the most important of all the virtues because without courage, you can't practice any other virtue consistently.


And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.


I was never really insane except upon occasions when my heart was touched.


Pain is temporary. Quitting lasts forever.


It's not the load that breaks you down, it's the way you carry it.


The things you do for yourself are gone when you are gone, but the things you do for others remain as your legacy.


It is good to love many things, for therein lies the true strength, and whosoever loves much performs much, and can accomplish much, and what is done in love is well done.


You need to learn how to select your thoughts just the same way you select your clothes every day. This is a power you can cultivate. If you want to control things in your life so bad, work on the mind. That's the only thing you should be trying to control.


And still, after all this time,

I dream my painting and I paint my dream.


Understanding is the first step to acceptance, and only with acceptance can there be recovery.


What you do makes a difference, and you have to decide what kind of difference you want to make.


Do you want to know who you are? Don't ask. Act! Action will delineate and define you.


If you treat an individual as he is, he will remain how he is. But if you treat him as if he were what he ought to be and could be, he will become what he ought to be and could be.


You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe, deserve your love and affection


Love is the absence of judgment.


There are years that ask questions and years that answer.


I read once that the ancient Egyptians had fifty words for sand & the Eskimos had a hundred words for snow. I wish I had a thousand words for love, but all that comes to mind is the way you move against me while you sleep & there are no words for that.


You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.

You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.


Do one thing every day that scares you.


We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be.


Sometimes you wake up. Sometimes the fall kills you. And sometimes, when you fall, you fly.


When we love, we always strive to become better than we are. When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better too.


Hold fast to dreams,

What's meant to be will always find a way


The flower that blooms in adversity is the rarest and most beautiful of all.


If you're reading this...

We delight in the beauty of the butterfly, but rarely admit the changes it has gone through to achieve that beauty.


You never have to change anything you got up in the middle of the night to write.


The unexamined life is not worth living.


Courage is the most important of all the virtues because without courage, you can't practice any other virtue consistently.


And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.


I was never really insane except upon occasions when my heart was touched.


Pain is temporary. Quitting lasts forever.


It's not the load that breaks you down, it's the way you carry it.


The things you do for yourself are gone when you are gone, but the things you do for others remain as your legacy.


It is good to love many things, for therein lies the true strength, and whosoever loves much performs much, and can accomplish much, and what is done in love is well done.


You need to learn how to select your thoughts just the same way you select your clothes every day. This is a power you can cultivate. If you want to control things in your life so bad, work on the mind. That's the only thing you should be trying to control.


And still, after all this time,

I dream my painting and I paint my dream.


Understanding is the first step to acceptance, and only with acceptance can there be recovery.


What you do makes a difference, and you have to decide what kind of difference you want to make.


Do you want to know who you are? Don't ask. Act! Action will delineate and define you.


If you treat an individual as he is, he will remain how he is. But if you treat him as if he were what he ought to be and could be, he will become what he ought to be and could be.


You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe, deserve your love and affection


Love is the absence of judgment.


There are years that ask questions and years that answer.

The reason it hurts so much to separate is because our souls are connected. Maybe they always have been and will be. Maybe we've lived a thousand lives before this one and in each of them we've found each other. And maybe each time, we've been forced apart for the same reasons. That means that this goodbye is both a goodbye for the past ten thousand years and a prelude to what will come.


Ignore those that make you fearful and sad, that degrade you back towards disease and death.


To give pleasure to a single heart by a single act is better than a thousand heads bowing in prayer.


Cry. Forgive. Learn. Move on. Let your tears water the seeds of your future happiness.


You can't wait for inspiration. You have to go after it with a club.


Romance is the glamour which turns the dust of everyday life into a golden haze.


The only thing standing between you and your goal is the bullshit story you keep telling yourself as to why you can't achieve it.


Tomorrow will be better.

It's hard to beat a person who never gives up.


It was only a sunny smile, and little it cost in the giving, but like morning light it scattered the night and made the day worth living.


I've been in love before, it's like a narcotic. At first it brings the euphoria of complete surrender. The next day you want more. You're not addicted yet, but you like the sensation, and you think you can still control things.You think about the person you love for two minutes then forget them for three hours. But then you get used to that person, and you begin to be completely dependent on them. Now you think about him for three hours and forget him for two minutes. If he's not there, you feel like an addict who can't get a fix. And just as addicts steal and humiliate themselves to get what they need, you're willing to do anything for love.- By the River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept


You can search throughout the entire universe for someone who is more deserving of your love and affection than you are yourself, and that person is not to be found anywhere. You, yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe, deserve your love and affection.


When someone tells me no, it doesn't mean I can't do it, it simply means I can't do it with them.


The soul is healed by being with children.


For me, I am driven by two main philosophies: know more today about the world than I knew yesterday and lessen the suffering of others. You'd be surprised how far that gets you.


Do stuff. be clenched, curious. Not waiting for inspiration's shove or society's kiss on your forehead. Pay attention. It's all about paying attention. attention is vitality. It connects you with others. It makes you eager. stay eager.


Risks must be taken because the greatest hazard in life is to risk nothing.


Why do they always teach us that it's easy and evil to do what we want and that we need discipline to restrain ourselves? It's the hardest thing in the world--to do what we want. And it takes the greatest kind of courage. I mean, what we really want.


The only person who can pull me down is myself, and I'm not going to let myself pull me down anymore.


Music has always been a matter of Energy to me, a question of Fuel. Sentimental people call it Inspiration, but what they really mean is Fuel. I have always needed Fuel. I am a serious consumer. On some nights I still believe that a car with the gas needle on empty can run about fifty more miles if you have the right music very loud on the radio.


When all is said and done, more is said than done.


The greatest disease in the West today is not TB or leprosy; it is being unwanted, unloved, and uncared for. We can cure physical diseases with medicine, but the only cure for loneliness, despair, and hopelessness is love. There are many in the world who are dying for a piece of bread but there are many more dying for a little love. The poverty in the West is a different kind of poverty -- it is not only a poverty of loneliness but also of spirituality. There's a hunger for love, as there is a hunger for God.


Our wounds are often the openings into the best and most beautiful part of us.


Aerodynamically, the bumble bee shouldn't be able to fly, but the bumble bee doesn't know it so it goes on flying anyway.


Those who contemplate the beauty of the earth find reserves of strength that will endure as long as life lasts. There is something infinitely healing in the repeated refrains of nature -- the assurance that dawn comes after night, and spring after winter.


All the effort in the world won't matter if you're not inspired.


There is no dishonor in losing the race. There is only dishonor in not racing because you are afraid to lose.


I have been and still am a seeker, but I have ceased to question stars and books; I have begun to listen to the teaching my blood whispers to me.


I never made one of my discoveries through the process of rational thinking


You'll never get ahead of anyone as long as you try to get even with him.


The animal merely makes a bed, which he warms with his body in a sheltered place; but man, having discovered fire, boxes up some air in a spacious apartment, and warms that, instead of robbing himself, makes that his bed, in which he can move about divested of more cumbrous clothing, maintain a kind of summer in the midst of winter, and by means of windows even admit the light and with a lamp lengthen out the day.


So comes snow after fire, and even dragons have their endings.


I ask not for any crown

Even if I knew that tomorrow the world would go to pieces, I would still plant my apple tree.


With the new day comes new strength and new thoughts.


I'm not in search of sanctity, sacredness, purity; these things are found after this life, not in this life; but in this life I search to be completely human: to feel, to give, to take, to laugh, to get lost, to be found, to dance, to love and to lust, to be so human.


If you're going to be crazy, you have to get paid for it or else you're going to be locked up.


Nothing is original. Steal from anywhere that resonates with inspiration or fuels your imagination. Devour old films, new films, music, books, paintings, photographs, poems, dreams, random conversations, architecture, bridges, street signs, trees, clouds, bodies of water, light and shadows. Select only things to steal from that speak directly to your soul. If you do this, your work (and theft) will be authentic. Authenticity is invaluable; originality is non-existent. And don't bother concealing your thievery - celebrate it if you feel like it. In any case, always remember what Jean-Luc Godard said: It's not where you take things from - it's where you take them to.

When you're at the end of your rope, tie a knot and hold on


Get going. Move forward. Aim High. Plan a takeoff. Don't just sit on the runway and hope someone will come along and push the airplane. It simply won't happen. Change your attitude and gain some altitude. Believe me, you'll love it up here.


Imagination is the highest form of research.


You're never as good as everyone tells you when you win, and you're never as bad as they say when you lose.


My Lord God, I have no idea where I am going. I do not see the road ahead of me. I cannot know for certain where it will end. Nor do I really know myself, and the fact that I think that I am following your will does not mean that I am actually doing so. But I believe that the desire to please you does in fact please you. And I hope I have that desire in all that I am doing. I hope that I will never do anything apart from that desire. And I know that if I do this you will lead me by the right road though I may know nothing about it. Therefore will I trust you always though I may seem to be lost and in the shadow of death. I will not fear, for you are ever with me, and you will never leave me to face my perils alone.


In a closed society where everybody's guilty, the only crime is getting caught. In a world of thieves, the only final sin is stupidity.


There is freedom waiting for you,

Your conscience is the measure of the honesty of your selfishness.

You must give everything to make your life as beautiful as the dreams that dance in your imagination.


Live your truth. Express your love. Share your enthusiasm. Take action towards your dreams. Walk your talk. Dance and sing to your music. Embrace your blessings. Make today worth remembering.


You must not ever stop being whimsical. And you must not, ever, give anyone else the responsibility for your life.


The problem with people is they forget that most of the time it's the small things that count.


The price of greatness is responsibility.


Silently, one by one, in the infinite meadows of heaven,

It's not what you say out of your mouth that determines your life, it's what you whisper to yourself that has the most power!


When we give cheerfully and accept gratefully, everyone is blessed.


No matter how bad things are, you can always make things worse.


Genius is one percent inspiration, ninety-nine percent perspiration.


Anger ... it's a paralyzing emotion ... you can't get anything done. People sort of think it's an interesting, passionate, and igniting feeling  I don't think it's any of that  it's helpless ... it's absence of control  and I need all of my skills, all of the control, all of my powers ... and anger doesn't provide any of that  I have no use for it whatsoever.

Don't loaf and invite inspiration; light out after it with a club.


The individual who says it is not possible should move out of the way of those doing it.


What the superior man seeks is in himself; what the small man seeks is in others.


Your life is an occasion. Rise to it.


People take different roads seeking fulfillment and happiness. Just because they're not on your road doesn't mean they've gotten lost.


A single day is enough to make us a little larger or, another time, a little smaller.


However mean your life is, meet it and live it; do not shun it and call it hard names. It is not so bad as you are. It looks poorest when you are richest. The fault-finder will find faults even in paradise. Love your life, poor as it is. You may perhaps have some pleasant, thrilling, glorious hours, even in a poorhouse.

If you want to be happy, do not dwell in the past, do not worry about the future, focus on living fully in the present.


The first and final thing you have to do in this world is to last it and not be smashed by it.


There are never enough 'I love you's.


I like to imagine that the world is one big machine. You know, machines never have any extra parts. They have the exact number and type of parts they need. So I figure if the entire world is a big machine, I have to be here for some reason. And that means you have to be here for some reason, too.


Acts of Kindness:

Life gives us choices. You either grab on with both hands and just go for it, or you sit on the sidelines.


When you look for a man- what you want to look for is a man with the heart of a poor boy and the mind of a conqueror.


Instead of worrying about what you cannot control, shift your energy to what you can create.


Poetry is just the evidence of life. If your life is burning well, poetry is just the ash.


The things we do outlast our mortality. The things we do are like monuments that people build to honor heroes after they've died. They're like the pyramids that the Egyptians built to honor the pharaohs. Only instead of being made of stone, they're made out of the memories people have of you.


Dreams are only dreams until you wake up and make them real.


People tend to be generous when sharing their nonsense, fear, and ignorance. And while they seem quite eager to feed you their negativity, please remember that sometimes the diet we need to be on is a spiritual and emotional one. Be cautious with what you feed your mind and soul. Fuel yourself with positivity and let that fuel propel you into positive action.


It doesn't matter what you did or where you were...it matters where you are and what you're doing. Get out there! Sing the song in your heart and NEVER let anyone shut you up!!


The more you feed your mind with positive thoughts, the more you can attract great things into your life.


Take it easy, but take it.


Hikayatin mo lahat ng kakilala mo na magkaroon ng kahit isa man lang paboritong libro sa buhay nila. Dahil wala nang mas kawawa pa sa mga taong literado pero hindi nagbabasa.


We are all different. Don't judge, understand instead.


It's only after you've stepped outside your comfort zone that you begin to change, grow, and transform.


I have learned that you can go anywhere you want to go and do anything you want to do and buy all the things that you want to buy and meet all the people that you want to meet and learn all the things that you desire to learn and if you do all these things but are not madly in love: you have still not begun to live.


Unrequited love is the infinite curse of a lonely heart.


A bruise is a lesson... and each lesson makes us better.


The tree which moves some to tears of joy is in the eyes of others only a green thing that stands in the way. Some see nature all ridicule and deformity... and some scarce see nature at all. But to the eyes of the man of imagination, nature is imagination itself.


Societies in decline have no use for visionaries.


You cannot expect victory and plan for defeat.


Life is filled with unanswered questions, but it is the courage to seek those answers that continues to give meaning to life. You can spend your life wallowing in despair, wondering why you were the one who was led towards the road strewn with pain, or you can be grateful that you are strong enough to survive it.


speak quietly to yourself & promise there will be better days. whisper gently to yourself and provide assurance that you really are extending your best effort. console your bruised and tender spirit with reminders of many other successes. offer comfort in practical and tangible ways - as if you were encouraging your dearest friend. recognize that on certain days the greatest grace is that the day is over and you get to close your eyes. tomorrow comes more brightly...


You are the only you God made... God made you and broke the mold.


Attitude is a choice. Happiness is a choice. Optimism is a choice. Kindness is a choice. Giving is a choice. Respect is a choice. Whatever choice you make makes you. Choose wisely.


Success is not how high you have climbed, but how you make a positive difference to the world.


Listen with curiosity. Speak with honesty. Act with integrity. The greatest problem with communication is we don't listen to understand. We listen to reply. When we listen with curiosity, we don't listen with the intent to reply. We listen for what's behind the words.


Help others without any reason and give without the expectation of receiving anything in return.


Believe in Your Heart

Live the Life of Your Dreams: Be brave enough to live the life of your dreams according to your vision and purpose instead of the expectations and opinions of others.


The only way to make sense out of change is to plunge into it, move with it, and join the dance.


You are the master of your destiny. You can influence, direct and control your own environment. You can make your life what you want it to be.


I never liked jazz music because jazz music doesn't resolve. But I was outside the Bagdad Theater in Portland one night when I saw a man playing the saxophone. I stood there for fifteen minutes, and he never opened his eyes.

Respect other people's feelings. It might mean nothing to you, but it could mean everything to them.


Why must people kneel down to pray? If I really wanted to pray I'll tell you what I'd do. I'd go out into a great big field all alone or in the deep, deep woods and I'd look up into the skyupupupinto that lovely blue sky that looks as if there was no end to its blueness. And then I'd just feel a prayer.


Be thankful for everything that happens in your life; it's all an experience.


If you have a dream, don't just sit there. Gather courage to believe that you can succeed and leave no stone unturned to make it a reality.


Do what is right, not what is easy nor what is popular.


Life becomes easier and more beautiful when we can see the good in other people.


Top 15 Things Money Can't Buy

Be mindful. Be grateful. Be positive. Be true. Be kind.


We are all equal in the fact that we are all different. We are all the same in the fact that we will never be the same. We are united by the reality that all colours and all cultures are distinct & individual. We are harmonious in the reality that we are all held to this earth by the same gravity. We don't share blood, but we share the air that keeps us alive. I will not blind myself and say that my black brother is not different from me. I will not blind myself and say that my brown sister is not different from me. But my black brother is he as much as I am me. But my brown sister is she as much as I am me.


There are, it seems, two muses: the Muse of Inspiration, who gives us inarticulate visions and desires, and the Muse of Realization, who returns again and again to say It is yet more difficult than you thought. This is the muse of form. It may be then that form serves us best when it works as an obstruction, to baffle us and deflect our intended course. It may be that when we no longer know what to do, we have come to our real work and when we no longer know which way to go, we have begun our real journey. The mind that is not baffled is not employed. The impeded stream is the one that sings.

No amount of regretting can change the past, and no amount of worrying can change the future.


It's worth making time to find the things that really stir your soul. That's what makes you really feel alive. You have to say 'no' to other things you're used to, and do it with all your heart.


Be grateful for what you already have while you pursue your goals.

It had been startling and disappointing to me to find out that story books had been written by people, that books were not natural wonders, coming up of themselves like grass. Yet regardless of where they come from, I cannot remember a time when I was not in love with them -- with the books themselves, cover and binding and the paper they were printed on, with their smell and their weight and with their possession in my arms, captured and carried off to myself. Still illiterate, I was ready for them, committed to all the reading I could give them ...


Do you understand how amazing it is to hear that from an adult? Do you know how amazing it is to hear that from anybody? It's one of the simplest sentences in the world, just four words, but they're the four hugest words in the world when they're put together.

I have stolen ideas from every book I have ever read.

I don't know why people are afraid of lust. Then I can imagine that they are very afraid of me, for I have a great lust for everything.

7 Effective Ways to Make Others Feel Important

You Are the Master of Your Attitude

Don't waste your time in anger, regrets, worries, and grudges. Life is too short to be unhappy.


Perfectionism is the enemy of happiness. Embrace being perfectly imperfect. Learn from your mistakes and forgive yourself, you'll be happier. We make mistakes because we are imperfect. Learn from your mistakes, forgive yourself, and keep moving forward.


It's never too late to change your life for the better. You don't have to take huge steps to change your life. Making even the smallest changes to your daily routine can make a big difference to your life.


Don't let the expectations and opinions of other people affect your decisions. It's your life, not theirs. Do what matters most to you; do what makes you feel alive and happy. Don't let the expectations and ideas of others limit who you are. If you let others tell you who you are, you are living their reality  not yours. There is more to life than pleasing people. There is much more to life than following others' prescribed path. There is so much more to life than what you experience right now. You need to decide who you are for yourself. Become a whole being. Adventure.


I stay cool, and dig all jive,

We must assume every event has significance and contains a message that pertains to our questions...this especially applies to what we used to call bad things...the challenge is to find the silver lining in every event, no matter how negative.

Happiness depends on your mindset and attitude.


My life isn't theories and formulae. It's part instinct, part common sense. Logic is as good a word as any, and I've absorbed what logic I have from everything and everyone... from my mother, from training as a ballet dancer, from Vogue magazine, from the laws of life and health and nature.


If you will practice being fictional for a while, you will understand that fictional characters are sometimes more real than people with bodies and heartbeats.


To see and feel one's beloved naked for the first time is one of life's pure, irreducible epiphanies. If there is a true religion in the universe, it must include that truth of contact or be forever hollow. To make love to the one true person who deserves that love is one of the few absolute rewards of being a human being, balancing all of the pain, loss, awkwardness, loneliness, idiocy, compromise, and clumsiness that go with the human condition. To make love to the right person makes up for a lot of mistakes.


Sometimes you have to lose all you have to find out who you truly are.


First forget inspiration. Habit is more dependable. Habit will sustain you whether you're inspired or not. Habit will help you finish and polish your stories. Inspiration won't. Habit is persistence in practice.


Don't give me songs, give me something to sing about!


The inner fire is the most important thing mankind possesses.


This is my living faith, an active faith, a faith of verbs: to question, explore, experiment, experience, walk, run, dance, play, eat, love, learn, dare, taste, touch, smell, listen, speak, write, read, draw, provoke, emote, scream, sin, repent, cry, kneel, pray, bow, rise, stand, look, laugh, cajole, create, confront, confound, walk back, walk forward, circle, hide, and seek.


Stop comparing yourself to other people, just choose to be happy and live your own life.


I cannot compromise my respect for your love. You can keep your love, I will keep my respect.

There's more to life than love.


Courage is feeling fear, not getting rid of fear, and taking action in the face of fear.


The advice I like to give young artists, or really anybody who'll listen to me, is not to wait around for inspiration. Inspiration is for amateurs; the rest of us just show up and get to work. If you wait around for the clouds to part and a bolt of lightning to strike you in the brain, you are not going to make an awful lot of work. All the best ideas come out of the process; they come out of the work itself. Things occur to you. If you're sitting around trying to dream up a great art idea, you can sit there a long time before anything happens. But if you just get to work, something will occur to you and something else will occur to you and something else that you reject will push you in another direction. Inspiration is absolutely unnecessary and somehow deceptive. You feel like you need this great idea before you can get down to work, and I find that's almost never the case.


You are in charge of your own happiness; you don't need to wait for other people's permission to be happy.


Writing is something that you don't know how to do. You sit down and it's something that happens, or it may not happen. So, how can you teach anybody how to write? It's beyond me, because you yourself don't even know if you're going to be able to. I'm always worried, well, you know, every time I go upstairs with my wine bottle. Sometimes I'll sit at that typewriter for fifteen minutes, you know. I don't go up there to write. The typewriter's up there. If it doesn't start moving, I say, well this could be the night that I hit the dust.


Face reality as it is, not as it was or as you wish it to be.


We habitually erect a barrier called blame that keeps us from communicating genuinely with others, and we fortify it with our concepts of who's right and who's wrong. We do that with the people who are closest to us and we do it with political systems, with all kinds of things that we don't like about our associates or our society.

Hope costs nothing.


You are not rich until you have a rich heart.


Collect books, even if you don't plan on reading them right away. Nothing is more important than an unread library.


If you get stuck, get away from your desk. Take a walk, take a bath, go to sleep, make a pie, draw, listen to ­music, meditate, exercise; whatever you do, don't just stick there scowling at the problem. But don't make telephone calls or go to a party; if you do, other people's words will pour in where your lost words should be. Open a gap for them, create a space. Be patient.

Pursue what catches your heart, not what catches your eyes.


There are two things we should always be 1. raw and 2. ready. When you are raw, you are always ready and when you are ready you usually realize that you are raw. Waiting for perfection is not an answer, one cannot say I will be ready when I am perfect because then you will never be ready, rather one must say I am raw and I am ready just like this right now, how and who I am.


When you do the right thing, you get the feeling of peace and serenity associated with it. Do it again and again.


It doesn't matter how many times you get knocked down. All that matters is you get up one more time than you were knocked down.


Turn around and believe that the good news that we are loved is better than we ever dared hope, and that to believe in that good news, to live out of it and toward it, to be in love with that good news, is of all glad things in this world the gladdest thing of all. Amen, and come Lord Jesus.

To shine your brightest light is to be who you truly are.


Believe in your infinite potential. Your only limitations are those you set upon yourself.


Politeness is okay, but it gets old and boring. You want to attack life with a passion, not a politeness, you want people to think about you and remember you and say she is so passionate you don't want people to think about you and remember you and say she is so polite, because, who cares about polite?


Failure is a bend in the road, not the end of the road. Learn from failure and keep moving forward.

The probability that we may fail in the struggle ought not to deter us

Don't blow off another's candle for it won't make yours shine brighter.


Never lose hope. Storms make people stronger and never last forever.


You either have to write or you shouldn't be writing. That's all.


Always believe in yourself and always stretch yourself beyond your limits. Your life is worth a lot more than you think because you are capable of accomplishing more than you know. You have more potential than you think, but you will never know your full potential unless you keep challenging yourself and pushing beyond your own self imposed limits.

There is really nothing more to say-except why. But since why is difficult to handle, one must take refuge in how.


Discipline Your Mind to Think Positively: Discipline your mind to see the good in every situation and look on the best side of every event.


It's important that what thoughts you are feeding into your mind because your thoughts create your belief and experiences. You have positive thoughts and you have negative ones too. Nurture your mind with positive thoughts: kindness, empathy, compassion, peace, love, joy, humility, generosity, etc. The more you feed your mind with positive thoughts, the more you can attract great things into your life.

Not only is there often a right and wrong, but what goes around does come around, Karma exists, chickens do come home to roost, and as my mother, Phyllis, liked to say, There is always a day of reckoning. The good among the great understand that every choice we make adds to the strength or weakness of our spiritsourselves, or to use an old fashioned word for the same idea, our souls.

We are important and our lives are important, magnificent really, and their details are worthy to be recorded. This is how writers must think, this is how we must sit down with pen in hand. We were here; we are human beings; this is how we lived. Let it be known, the earth passed before us. Our details are important. Otherwise, if they are not, we can drop a bomb and it doesn't matter. . . Recording the details of our lives is a stance against bombs with their mass ability to kill, against too much speed and efficiency. A writer must say yes to life, to all of life: the water glasses, the Kemp's half-and-half, the ketchup on the counter. It is not a writer's task to say, It is dumb to live in a small town or to eat in a café when you can eat macrobiotic at home. Our task is to say a holy yes to the real things of our life as they exist – the real truth of who we are: several pounds overweight, the gray, cold street outside, the Christmas tinsel in the showcase, the Jewish writer in the orange booth across from her blond friend who has black children. We must become writers who accept things as they are, come to love the details, and step forward with a yes on our lips so there can be no more noes in the world, noes that invalidate life and stop these details from continuing.

Instead of worrying about what could go wrong, change your thoughts to what could go right. When you change the negative thought into a positive one, it eliminates the negative one.


There is no such thing as a problem without a gift for you in its hands. You seek problems because you need their gifts.


How much you can learn when you fail determines how far you will go into achieving your goals.


If you make art, people will talk about it. Some of the things they say will be nice, some won't. You'll already have made that art, and when they're talking about the last thing you did, you should already be making the next thing.

The downfall of the attempts of governments and leaders to unite mankind is found in this- in the wrong message that we should see everyone as the same. This is the root of the failure of harmony. Because the truth is, we should not all see everyone as the same! We are not the same! We are made of different colours and we have different cultures. We are all different! But the key to this door is to look at these differences, respect these differences, learn from and about these differences, and grow in and with these differences. We are all different. We are not the same. But that's beautiful. And that's okay.In the quest for unity and peace, we cannot blind ourselves and expect to be all the same. Because in this, we all have an underlying belief that everyone should be the same as us at some point. We are not on a journey to become the same or to be the same. But we are on a journey to see that in all of our differences, that is what makes us beautiful as a human race, and if we are ever to grow, we ought to learn and always learn some more.


Failure is an event, never a person.


One of the best ways to influence people is to make them feel important. Most people enjoy those rare moments when others make them feel important. It is one of the deepest human desires.


Good people see the good and bring out the best in other people.


There are some values that you should never compromise on to stay true to yourself; you should be brave to stand up for what you truly believe in even if you stand alone.


Every challenge you face today makes you stronger tomorrow. The challenge of life is intended to make you better, not bitter.


The level of success you achieve will be in direct proportion to the depth of your commitment.


Stories make us more alive, more human, more courageous, more loving.


So many of our dreams at first seem impossible, then they seem improbable, and then, when we summon the will, they soon become inevitable.


Be fearless. Have the courage to take risks. Go where there are no guarantees. Get out of your comfort zone even if it means being uncomfortable. The road less traveled is sometimes fraught with barricades bumps and uncharted terrain. But it is on that road where your character is truly tested And have the courage to accept that you're not perfect nothing is and no one is  and that's OK.


I believe that what we get out of life is what we've set ourselves up to get, so there's no such thing as an inconsequential decision. Our destinies are the culmination of all the choices we've made along the way, which is why it's imperative to listen hard to your inner voice when it speaks up.

Everyone enjoys being acknowledged and appreciated. Sometimes even the simplest act of gratitude can change someone's entire day. Take the time to recognize and value the people around you and appreciate those who make a difference in your lives.


Stop doing what is easy or popular. Start doing what is right.


The comfort zone is a psychological state in which one feels familiar, safe, at ease, and secure. You never change your life until you step out of your comfort zone; change begins at the end of your comfort zone.


If you don't know who you truly are, you'll never know what you really want.


Focus on your goals, not your fear.

Until you step into the unknown, you don't know what you're made of.


It was so strange, the way that life moved forward: the twists and the dead ends, the sudden opportunities. She supposed if you could predict or foresee everything that was going to happen, you'd lose the motivation to go through it all. The promise was always in the possibility.


If you have kindness in your heart, you offer acts of kindness to touch the hearts of others wherever you gowhether they are random or planned. Kindness becomes a way of life.


Don't set your goals by what other people deem important.


Everyone you meet is a part of your journey, but not all of them are meant to stay in your life. Some people are just passing through to bring you gifts; either they're blessings or lessons.


Never judge a work of art by its defects


Inspiration is always a surprising visitor.


I am my own experiment. I am my own work of art.


I just want to do something that matters. Or be something that matters. I just want to matter.


Keep your promises and be consistent. Be the kind of person others can trust.


Life is short. Focus on what really matters most; you should change your priorities over time.


The potential of the average person is like a huge ocean unsailed, a

Failures are the stairs we climb to reach success.


Do you train for passing tests or do you train for creative inquiry?


Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? 36 As it is written: For your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered. 37 No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. 38 For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, 39 neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.


Create your own miracles; do what you think you cannot do.


Make the most of what you have and keep your standards high. Never settle for anything less than you deserve or are capable of achieving.


In my experience, nothing worthwhile has ever really been all that easy. But it certainly has been worthwhile regardless how difficult it seemed.


A challenge only becomes an obstacle when you bow to it.


All water has a perfect memory and is forever trying to get back to where it was.


Maybe it's what we don't say/that saves us.


There's nothing more inspiring than the complexity and beauty of the human heart.


Gamitin ang puso para alagaan ang taong malapit sayo. Gamitin ang utak

The way I define happiness is being the creator of your experience, choosing to take pleasure in what you have, right now, regardless of the circumstances, while being the best you that you can be.


Love is only a word, until we decide to let it possess us with all its force.

Chase your dreams until you catch them...and then dream, catch, and dream again!


Friendship is like peeing on yourself: everyone can see it, but only you get the warm feeling that it brings.


I must work harder to achieve my goal of not seeking approval from those whose approval I'm not even sure is important to me.


Nothing makes a person happier than having a happy heart.


It is when we think we can act like God, that all respect is lost, and I think this is the downfall of peace. We lie if we say we do not see color and culture and difference. We fool ourselves and cheat ourselves when we say that all of us are the same. We should not want to be the same as others and we should not want others to be the same as us. Rather, we ought to glory and shine in all of our differences, flaunting them fabulously for all to see! It is never a conformity that we need! We need not to conform! What we need is to burst out into all these beautiful colors!


I don't know exactly where ideas come from, but when I'm working well ideas just appear. I've heard other people say similar things - so it's one of the ways I know there's help and guidance out there. It's just a matter of our figuring out how to receive the ideas or information that are waiting to be heard.


Do not let the roles you play in life make you forget who you are.


A deadline is negative inspiration. Still, it's better than no inspiration at all.


You attract who you are being. When you work at being the type of person that you want to attract, you attract those kinds of people into your life.


The most intriguing people you will encounter in this life are the people who had insights about you, that you didn't know about yourself.


Leaders are limited by their vision rather than by their abilities.


The world is merciless, and it's also very beautiful.


Change course, but don't give up.


Life teaches us the right path is rarely the easy one.


Finding the lesson behind every adversity will be the one important thing that helps get you through it.


Real change is difficult at the beginning. Without the familiar to rely upon, you may not in as much command as you had once been. When things are not going your way, you will start doubting yourself. Stay positive, keep the faith, and keep moving forward – your breakthrough may be just around the corner.


Be careful the stories you're telling yourself about your current circumstances; a head full of negative thoughts has no space for positive ones.


Your beliefs affect your choices. Your choices shape your actions. Your actions determine your results. The future you create depends upon the choices you make and the actions you take today.


You have come a long way and have won many battles. Whenever you're faced with a difficult or challenging situation, you'll overcome it. Yes, you can.


You will never follow your own inner voice until you clear up the doubts in your mind.


Until you change how you get things done, you'll never know what works best.


Do good, live in the most positive and joyful way possible every day.


Be the kind of person who dares to face life's challenges and overcome them rather than dodging them.


So I am not a broken heart.

Let go of something old that no longer serves you in order to make room for something new.


Silence is the language of Om. We need silence to be able to reach our Self. Both internal and external silence is very important to feel the presence of that supreme Love.


A NATION'S GREATNESS DEPENDS ON ITS LEADER

What you stay focused on will grow.


One of the best ways to influence people is to make them feel important.


A smile puts you on the right track. A smile makes the world a beautiful place. When you lose your smile, you lose your way in the chaos of life.


No one has ever achieved greatness without dreams.


Goals are the road maps that guide you to your destination.

What helps you persevere is your resilience and commitment.


Stay strong, stay positive, and never give up.




When you take control of your attitude, you take control of your life.


The greatest thing about dreams is they don't expire. They can lay dormant for years and when you pull them out and dust them off, they shine like new.


I learned...that inspiration does not come like a bolt, nor is it kinetic, energetic striving, but it comes into us slowly and quietly and all the time, though we must regularly and every day give it a little chance to start flowing, prime it with a little solitude and idleness.


Create a vision for the life you really want and then work relentlessly towards making it a reality.


Dedicate yourself to what gives your life true meaning and purpose; make a positive difference in someone's life.


If you care about someone enough, you'll always be there for them no matter what.


My love is something valuable to me which I ought not to throw away without reflection.


Hash, x. There is no definition for this word - nobody knows what hash is.

Keep your mind open. The meaning of things lies in how people perceive them. The same thing could mean different meanings to the same people at different times.


Your Life Is Happening Right Now: Don't let procrastination take over your life. Be brave and take risks. Your life is happening right now.


People always ask me

Focus on making choices to lead your life that aligns with your core values in the most purposeful way possible.


I'm restless. Things are calling me away. My hair is being pulled by the stars again.


Stop comparing yourself to others. Always strive to improve yourself to become better today than you were yesterday to serve those around you and the world.


What I think the political correctness debate is really about is the power to be able to define. The definers want the power to name. And the defined are now taking that power away from them.


Picasso had a saying - 'good artists copy, great artists steal' - and we have always been shameless about stealing great ideas.


You can t coast uphill.


Never run from the enemy, tackle them


No. In my eyes, she was most beautiful because at a time when she had every right to be terrified, she managed to show comfort to another person who needed it.


The past is a place of learning, not a place of living.


We are wiser than we know.


Talent is a wonderful thing, but it won't carry a quitter.


You couldn't erase the past. You couldn't even change it. But sometimes life offered you the opportunity to put it right.


‎What does it mean if i'm afraid? Does it mean something bad is going to happen? No, it doesn't mean something bad is going to happen. It just means that you have the chance to be brave.


Find a purpose to serve, not a lifestyle to live.


If you can approach the world's complexities, both its glories and its horrors, with an attitude of humble curiosity, acknowledging that however deeply you have seen, you have only scratched the surface, you will find worlds within worlds, beauties you could not heretofore imagine, and your own mundane preoccupations will shrink to proper size, not all that important in the greater scheme of things.


Be an Encourager: When you encourage others, you boost their self-esteem, enhance their self-confidence, make them work harder, lift their spirits and make them successful in their endeavors. Encouragement goes straight to the heart and is always available. Be an encourager. Always.


It was being a runner that mattered, not how fast or how far I could run. The joy was in the act of running and in the journey, not in the destination. We have a better chance of seeing where we are when we stop trying to get somewhere else. We can enjoy every moment of movement, as long as where we are is as good as where we'd like to be. That's not to say that you need to be satisfied forever with where you are today. But you need to honor what you've accomplished, rather than thinking of what's left to be done (p. 159).


When the poet Paul Valery once asked Albert Einstein if he kept a notebook to record his ideas, Einstein looked at him with mild but genuine surprise. Oh, that's not necessary, he replied . It's so seldom I have one.


Men are born to succeed, not to fail.


stand often in the company of dreamers: they tickle your common sense & believe you can achieve things which are impossible.


The biggest wall you have to climb is the one you build in your mind: Never let your mind talk you out of your dreams, trick you into giving up. Never let your mind become the greatest obstacle to success. To get your mind on the right track, the rest will follow.


I think of myself as a bad writer with big ideas, but I'd rather be that than a big writer with bad ideas.


Never let fear hold you captive.

It is the most fun I'm ever going to have. I love to write. I love it. I mean, there's nothing in the world I like better, and that includes sex, probably because I'm so very bad at it. It's the greatest peace when I'm in a scene, and it's just me and the character, that's it, that's where I want to live my life.


What it means to be authentic:

Great goals make great people. People cannot hit what they do not aim for.


Always Remember to take your Vitamins: Take your Vitamin A for ACTION, Vitamin B for Belief, Vitamin C for Confidence ,Vitamin D for Discipline, Vitamin E for Enthusiasm!!


I am so grateful for my troubles. As I reflect back on my life, I have come to realize that my greatest triumphs have been born of my greatest troubles.


I think you don't grow up until you stop worrying about other people's purposes or lack of them and find the purposes you believe in for yourself.


Just as anyone who listens to the muse will hear, you can write out of your own intention or out of inspiration. There is such a thing. It comes up and talks. And those who have heard deeply the rhythms and hymns of the gods, can recite those hymns in such a way that the gods will be attracted.


Halfway down the aisle, Jamie suddenly seemed to tire, and they stopped while she caught her breath...It was, I remembered thinking, the most difficult walk anyone ever had to make. In every way, a walk to remember.


I admire those who do good and expect nothing in return.


You have to salvage what you can, even if you're the one who buried it in the first place.


Sometimes you need to sit lonely on the floor in a quiet room in order to hear your own voice and not let it drown in the noise of others.


We all have negative thoughts now and then, but we can choose not to dwell there and not to let them control us.


People are successful because they think and act like successful people.


Whatever the mind of man can conceive and believe, it can achieve


Do more listening than talking; talk more about them than about you.


Participate in your dreams today. There are unlimited opportunities available with this new day. Take action on those wonderful dreams you've had in your mind for so long. Remember, success is something you experience when you act accordingly.


The systematic looting of language can be recognized by the tendency of its users to forgo its nuanced, complex, mid-wifery properties for menace and subjugation. Oppressive language does more than represent violence; it is violence; does more than represent the limits of knowledge; it limits knowledge. Whether it is obscuring state language or the faux-language of mindless media; whether it is the proud but calcified language of the academy or the commodity driven language of science; whether it is the malign language of law-without-ethics, or language designed for the estrangement of minorities, hiding its racist plunder in its literary cheek - it must be rejected, altered and exposed. It is the language that drinks blood, laps vulnerabilities, tucks its fascist boots under crinolines of respectability and patriotism as it moves relentlessly toward the bottom line and the bottomed-out mind. Sexist language, racist language, theistic language - all are typical of the policing languages of mastery, and cannot, do not permit new knowledge or encourage the mutual exchange of ideas.

Most of us are not raised to actively encounter our destiny. We may not know that we have one. As children, we are seldom told we have a place in life that is uniquely ours alone. Instead, we are encouraged to believe that our life should somehow fulfill the expectations of others, that we will (or should) find our satisfactions as they have found theirs. Rather than being taugh to ask ourselves who we are, we are schooled to ask others. We are, in effect, trained to listen to others' versions of ourselves. We are brought up in our life as told to us by someone else! When we survey our lives, seeking to fulfill our creativity, we often see we had a dream that went glimmering because we believed, and those around us believed, that the dream was beyond our reach. Many of us would have been, or at least might have been, done, tried something, if...

Improvement makes strait roads, but the crooked roads without Improvement, are roads of Genius.

Life is and will ever remain an equation incapable of solution, but it contains certain known factors.


All men are created equal. Now matter how hard they try, they can never erase those words. That is what America is about.


Sometimes you can learn, even from a bad experience. By coping you become stronger. The pain does not go away, but it becomes manageable.


Don't wait for things to happen. Make them happen.


I confess I do not know why, but looking at the stars always makes me dream.


Instead of complaining about the problem and blaming others, start finding the solution.


I've pursued dreams and achieved them, but I don't think anybody should think their life is incomplete if they don't follow some dream. Happiness doesn't come from achievements, or money, or any sort of treasure. Happiness is a frame of mind, not a destination. It's appreciating what you've got and building relationships with those around you.


A mind possessed by unmade books.


We light the oven so that everyone may bake bread in it.


I can do this... I can start over. I can save my own life and I'm never going to be alone as long as I have stars to wish on and people to still love.


In fact that is why the lives of most women are so vaguely unsatisfactory. They are always doing secondary and menial things (that do not require all their gifts and ability) for others and never anything for themselves. Society and husbands praise them for it (when they get too miserable or have nervous breakdowns) though always a little perplexedly and half-heartedly and just to be consoling. The poor wives are reminded that that is just why wives are so splendid -- because they are so unselfish and self-sacrificing and that is the wonderful thing about them! But inwardly women know that something is wrong. They sense that if you are always doing something for others, like a servant or nurse, and never anything for yourself, you cannot do others any good. You make them physically more comfortable. But you cannot affect them spiritually in any way at all. For to teach, encourage, cheer up, console, amuse, stimulate or advise a husband or children or friends, you have to be something yourself. [...]If you would shut your door against the children for an hour a day and say; 'Mother is working on her five-act tragedy in blank verse!' you would be surprised how they would respect you. They would probably all become playwrights.


No one wakes up in the morning and says, 'I want to gain 150 pounds and I will start right now!


To overcome fear is the quickest way to gain your self-confidence.


I wrote a book. It sucked. I wrote nine more books. They sucked, too. Meanwhile, I read every single thing I could find on publishing and writing, went to conferences, joined professional organizations, hooked up with fellow writers in critique groups, and didn't give up. Then I wrote one more book.


Regardless of Sunshine or Rain, Be Thankful for another GREAT day...and treat Life as the ULTIMATE Gift.... Because IT IS :)


Be patient and open-minded in your interactions with others; find the positive attributes that they possess.


Actually, writers have no business writing about their own works. They either wax conceited, saying things like: 'My brilliance is possibly most apparent in my dazzling short story, The Cookiepants Hypotenuse.' Or else they get unbearably cutesy: 'My cat Ootsywootums has given me all my best ideas, hasn't oo, squeezums?


We are always falling in love or quarreling, looking for jobs or fearing to lose them, getting ill and recovering, following public affairs. If we let ourselves, we shall always be waiting for some distraction or other to end before we can really get down to our work. The only people who achieve much are those who want knowledge so badly that they seek it while the conditions are still unfavorable. Favorable conditions never come.


I am the lover's gift; I am the wedding wreath;

One word of encouragement can be enough to spark someone's motivation to continue with a difficult challenge.


Be patient. Your skin took a while to deteriorate. Give it some time to reflect a calmer inner state. As one of my friends states on his Facebook profile: The true Losers in Life, are not those who Try and Fail, but those who Fail to Try.


Others may write from the head, but he writes from the heart, and the heart will always understand him.


Have you ever seen the dawn? Not a dawn groggy with lack of sleep or hectic with mindless obligations and you about to rush off on an early adventure or business, but full of deep silence and absolute clarity of perception? A dawning which you truly observe, degree by degree. It is the most amazing moment of birth. And more than anything it can spur you to action. Have a burning day.


I don't need any plastic in my body to validate me as a woman.


All I want in this life are three...

You have two choices, to conquer your fear or to let your fear conquer you.


Integrity is doing the right thing when nobody's watching, and doing as you say you would do.


Don't worry if people think you're crazy. You are crazy. You have that kind of intoxicating insanity that lets other people dream outside of the lines and become who they're destined to be.


The best way to become acquainted with a subject is to write about it.


The single greatest lesson the garden teaches is that our relationship to the planet need not be zero-sum, and that as long as the sun still shines and people still can plan and plant, think and do, we can, if we bother to try, find ways to provide for ourselves without diminishing the world.


Pride is a funny thing; it can make what is truly worthless appear to be a treasure.


But the past cannot be changed, and we carry our choices with us, forward, into the unknown. We can only move on.

Do you have any advice for your readers?

At that moment, the urge to be writing was stronger than any notion she had of what she might write.


You make the world a better place by making daily improvements to become the best version of yourself.


I'll be inside the one who holds you. And then I won't be.


Stop trying to be less of who you are. Let this time in your life cut you open and drain all of the things that are holding you back.


You don't need to wait for inspiration to write. It's easier to be inspired while writing that while not writing...


To wander is to be alive.


Remember that things are not always as they appear to be... Curiosity creates possibilities and opportunities.


The most important thing is this: to be able at any moment to be free to choose a life that makes you happy.


One of the best ways to influence people is to make those around you feel important.


The more you talk about them, the more important they will feel. The more you listen to them, the more important you will make them feel.


Real change is difficult at the beginning, but gorgeous at the end. Change begins the moment you get the courage and step outside your comfort zone; change begins at the end of your comfort zone.


Most good things have already been said far too many times and just need to be lived.


Music is pleasing not only because of the sound but because of the silence that is in it: without the alternation of sound and silence there would be no rhythm.


People who do not love themselves can adore others, because adoration is making someone else big and ourselves small. They can desire others, because desire comes out of sense of inner incompleteness, which demands to be filled. But they can not love others, because love is an affirmation of the living growing being in all of us. If you don't have it, you cant give it.


Pippa's laugh is bitter, tinged with tears. 'Ha! Why do girls think being beautiful will solve every problem? Being beautiful just creates problems. It's a misery. I wish I were someone else.

To assess the quality of thoughts of people, don't listen to their words, but watch their actions.


If someone loves you, they should not be envious of you pouring your heart and soul and time and energy into the things that you are passionate about, but instead....they should love you MORE because you are so involved in those things.


Life is difficult for everyone. We all have stress and we all need someone in our lives that we can lean on. Never think that you cannot talk to someone because they have problems to or that your friend or loved one would be better off without you or your problems. You'll soon find out that they need you just as much as you need them.


Imagine others complexly.


You say I started out with practically nothing, but that isn't correct. We all start with all there is, it's how we use it that makes things possible.


Beauty is not who you are on the outside, it is the wisdom and time you gave away to save another struggling soul like you.


We are at our most powerful the moment we no longer need to be powerful.


Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful, and so worship God acceptably with reverence and awe, for our God is a consuming fire.

It doesn't matter how great your shoes are if you don't accomplish anything in them.


History is a guide to navigation in perilous times. History is who we are and why we are the way we are.


The fact that you are still alive assures you that God has something for you to accomplish.


Someone has to write all those stories: why not me?


When I met a truly beautiful girl, I would tell her that if she spent the night with me, I would write a novel or a story about her. This usually worked; and if her name was to be in the title of the story, it almost always worked. Then, later, when we'd passed a night of delicious love-making together, after she'd gone and I'd felt that feeling of happiness mixed with sorrow, I sometimes would write a book or story about her. Sometimes her character, her way about herself, her love-making, it sometimes marked me so heavily that I couldn't go on in life and be happy unless I wrote a book or a story about that woman, the happy and sad memory of that woman. That was the only way to keep her, and to say goodbye to her without her ever leaving.


The more you believed in yourself, the more you could trust yourself. The more you trust yourself, the less you compare yourself to others.


There is absolutely no greater high than challenging the power structure as a nobody, giving it your all, and winning!


It is better to find your courage to make changes when you can choose to rather than being forced to. If you do not make change, change will make you.


It is difficult to make the right choice if you fear choosing wrongly.


The value of surrounding yourself with positive people is not what you get from them, but how good a person you have become because of them.


Adversity, if for no other reason, is of benefit, since it is sure to bring a season of sober reflection. People see clearer at such times. Storms purify the atmosphere.

Hello!

Although I have the colors, only the Lord can mix them with such harmony.


Now I found it in writing sentences. You can write that sentence in a way that you would have written it last year. Or you can write it in the way of the exquisite nuance that is sriting in your mind now. But that takes a lot of ... waiting for the right word to come.


A photograph shouldn't be just a picture, it should be a philosophy.


A man who denies his past is a man who truly denies himself a future, for he refuses to know himself, and to deny knowledge of oneself is to stumble through life as handicapped as the blind mute.


We have to live a life that is more revolutionary than that of the revolutionaries.


Don't let mental blocks control you. Set yourself free. Confront your fear and turn the mental blocks into building blocks.


There are powers far beyond us, plans far beyond what we could have ever thought of, visions far more vast than what we can ever see on our own with our own eyes, there are horizons long gone beyond our own horizons. This is courage- to throw away what is our own that is limited and to thrust ourselves into the hands of these higher powers- God and Destiny.To do this is to abide in the realm of the eternal, to walk in the path of the everlasting to follow in the footprints of God and demi-gods. The hardest part for man is the letting go. For some reason, he thinks himself big enough to know and to see what's good for him. But in the letting go........is found freedom. In the letting go........ is found the flight!


Alcohol makes other people less tedious, and food less bland, and can help provide what the Greeks called

Rule your mind or it will rule you.


You are an Universe of Universes and your soul a source of songs.


We are told that talent creates its own opportunities. But it sometimes seems that intense desire creates not only its own opportunities but its own talents.


I know a girl from whose body sunbeams rose to the clouds as if they'd fallen from the sun.

On Living

If we are not allowed to deal with small problems, we will be destroyed by slightly larger ones. When we come to understand this, we live our lives not avoiding problems, but welcoming them them as challenges that will strengthen us so that we can be victorious in the future.


it is (often) the quiet gesture which carries the most significance - the one which suddenly directs the symphony.


We have to endure the discordance between imagination and fact. It is better to say, I am suffering, than to say, This landscape is ugly.


Sometimes questions are more important than answers.


Jelas sekali bahwasanya rumah tangga yang aman damai ialah gabungan di antara tegapnya laki-laki dan halusnya perempuan


I've always hated the Who are you? question. This is a philosophical inquiry. Answering that question is why we're on earth. You can't answer it in thirty seconds or in an elevator.


Do Something!

To learn something new, you need to try new things and not be afraid to be wrong.


Nothing can be more hurtful to your heart than betraying yourself.


People often belittle the place where they were born but heaven can be found in the most unlikely places.


Shine your light and make a positive impact on the world; there is nothing so honorable as helping improve the lives of others.


Man is a spiritual being, a soul, and at some period of his life everyone is possessed with an irresistible desire to know his relationship to the Infinite. . . . There is something within him which urges him to rise above himself, to control his environment, to master the body and all things physical and live in a higher and more beautiful world.


The writer's only responsibility is to his art. He will be completely ruthless if he is a good one. He has a dream. It anguishes him so much he must get rid of it. He has no peace until then. Everything goes by the board: honor, pride, decency, security, happiness, all, to get the book written. If a writer has to rob his mother, he will not hesitate; the 'Ode on a Grecian Urn' is worth any number of old ladies.


Inspiration is external and motivation is internal. It is up to me to provide the switch and you to flip it on!


You need to have faith in yourself. Be brave and take risks. You don't have to have it all figured out to move forward.


Talent without discipline is like an octopus on roller skates. There's plenty of movement, but you never know if it's going to be forward, backwards, or sideways.


Every day is a journey filled with twists and turns. Every day, if you smile, you will feel alive, my son.


If everyone is thinking alike, then somebody isn't thinking.


World peace starts with the Creator- Jesus!!


We have different forms assigned to us in the school of life, different gifts imparted. All is not attractive that is good. Iron is useful, though it does not sparkle like the diamond. Gold has not the fragrance of a flower. So different persons have various modes of excellence, and we must have an eye to all.


There is only one all pervading God. It has only one message - Love all, encompass all and transcend the limits of the selfish gene.


Echo of your thoughts are more important than your actions because that has greater impact on the world.

The stars up close to the moon were pale; they got brighter and braver the farther they got out of the circle of light ruled by the giant moon


That's the trouble with loving a wild thing: You're always left watching the door.


I think fitting in is highly overrated. I'd rather just fit out... Fitting out means being who you are, even when people insist that you have to change. Fitting out means taking up space, not apologizing for yourself, and not agreeing with those who seek to label you with stereotypes.


When the creative impulse sweeps over you, grab it. You grab it and honor it and use it, because momentum is a rare gift.


Every villian is a hero in his own mind.


Faith is not about finding meaning in the world, there may be no such thing -- faith is the belief in our capacity to create meaningful lives.


Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal; bad poets deface what they take, and good poets make it into something better, or at least something different.


There are people who think that things that happen in fiction do not really happen. These people are wrong.


Success comes in a lot of ways, but it doesn't come with money and it doesn't come with fame. It comes from having a meaning in your life, doing what you love and being passionate

Because the world is so corrupted, misspoken, unstable, exaggerated and unfair, one should trust only what one can experience with one's own senses, and THIS makes the senses stronger in Italy than anywhere in Europe. This is why, Barzini says, Italians will tolerate hideously incompetent generals, presidents, tyrants, professors, bureaucrats, journalists and captain of industry, but will never tolerate incompetent opera singers, conductors, ballerinas, courtesans, actors, film directors, cooks, tailors... In a world of disorder and disaster and fraud, sometimes only beauty can be trusted. Only artistic excellence is incorruptible. Pleasure cannot be bargained down. And sometimes the meal is the only currency that is real.


We are, all of us, exploring a world none of us understands...searching for a more immediate, ecstatic, and penetrating mode of living...for the integrity, the courage to be whole, living in relation to one another in the full poetry of existence. The struggle for an integrated life existing in an atmosphere of communal trust and respect is one with desperately important political and social consequences...Fear is always with us, but we just don't have time for it.

When prescribing one of the drugs I take, my doctor warned me of a common side effect: exaggerated, intensely vivid dreams. To be honest, I've never really noticed the difference. I've always dreamt big.


Why give up?

If an apology is followed by an excuse or a reason, it means they are going to commit same mistake again they just apologized for.


I met a boy whose eyes showed me that the past, present and future were all the same thing.


All of us need to be in touch with a mysterious, tantalizing source of inspiration that teases our sense of wonder and goads us on to life's next adventure.


Follow your bliss and doors will open where there were no doors before.


Anyone can smile on their best day. I like to meet a man who can smile on his WORST.


When I type a title page, I hold it and I look at it and I think, I just need four thousand sentences to go with this and I'll have a book.


Accidents happen. Our bones shatter, our skin splits, our hearts break. We burn, we drown, we stay alive.


You did the best you could, the best you knew how at the time. It was something like that. From Oprah on an Oprah show. Then I believe my quote above was from Maya Angelou on the Oprah show, not Oprah herself. I had heard it before but it was on Oprah's show again 1-7-09 and she said Maya had said it.

سئل فولتر (1778م)عمن سيقود الجنس البشري؟ فأجاب:الذين يعرفون كيف يقرأو


He ran as he'd never run before, with neither hope nor despair. He ran because the world was divided into opposites and his side had already been chosen for him, his only choice being whether or not to play his part with heart and courage. He ran because fate had placed him in a position of responsibility and he had accepted the burden. He ran because his self-respect required it. He ran because he loved his friends and this was the only thing he could do to end the madness that was killing and maiming them.


Just as it is known

In presence of the Moon nobody sees stars.


Uniqueness is what makes you the most beautiful.


My days I devote to reading and experiments in chemistry, and I spend many of the clear nights in the study of astronomy. There is, though I do not know how there is or why there is, a sense of infinite peace and protection in the glittering hosts of heaven. There it must be, I think, in the vast and eternal laws of matter, and not in the daily cares and sins and troubles of men, that whatever is more than animal within us must find its solace and its hope.


What a lover's heart knows let no man's brain dispute.


I don't have a diary, I don't write things into a diary. I imprint myself into the sky and when the sunlight shines brightly, I can stand under the sun's rays and everything I have imprinted of myself into the sky, I will begin to see again, feel again, remember. And when the wind begins to blow, it blows the details over my face, and I remember everything I left in the sky and see new things being born. I am unwritten.


Tears are a river that takes you somewhere...Tears lift your boat off the rocks, off dry ground, carrying it downriver to someplace better.


Life's managed, not cured.


For so many years, I couldn't understand why every time I thought that someone finally loved me, like... for real, they would eventually turn to vapor. Every person whom I've ever loved is trapped inside of my chest. I've breathed all of them in so deeply that I've nearly choked and died on every soul that I've ever given myself to.


Receive with simplicity everything that happens to you.


Reason, Observation and Experience  the Holy Trinity of Science  have taught us that happiness is the only good; that the time to be happy is now, and the way to be happy is to make others so. This is enough for us. In this belief we are content to live and die. If by any possibility the existence of a power superior to, and independent of, nature shall be demonstrated, there will then be time enough to kneel. Until then, let us stand erect.


When I touched her body,

Too many people out there tell us what we can and cannot do but...they don't know who we are, what's put in us.


I tell people not to be afraid of their fears; because their fears are not there to scare them, they're there to let them know that something is worth it. Yet I am often afraid. I guess that means in my life, lots of things have been worth it!


The soil in which the meditative mind can begin is the soil of everyday life, the strife, the pain, and the fleeting joy. It must begin there, and bring order, and from there move endlessly. But if you are concerned only with making order, then that very order will bring about its own limitation, and the mind will be its prisoner. In all this movement you must somehow begin from the other end, from the other shore, and not always be concerned with this shore or how to cross the river. You must take a plunge into the water, not knowing how to swim. And the beauty of meditation is that you never know where you are, where you are going, what the end is.


We only live once. We all have an expiration date after that we will never come again. I am not saying that to make you sad. I am saying that so you can cherish each moment in your life and be grateful that you are here and you are Special


Inspiration is the windfall from hard work and focus. Muses are too unreliable to keep on the payroll.


Whether I fail or succeed shall be no man's doing but my own.

We can become inspired to shape a higher, more ideal future, and when we do, miracles happen.

Call on God, but row away from the rocks.


APPLY WITHIN

We don't truly appreciate what we have until it's gone... We don't really appreciate something until we have experienced some events; we don't really appreciate our parents until we ourselves have become parents. Be grateful for what you have now, and nothing should be taken for granted.


Stay away from conflictive, negative people that pull you down, because they contaminate your energy and impede your progress. Search for people who look at the world with optimism, that inspire you, make you happy and provide peace of mind.


The Fact That You Have The Ability To Stand On Stage And Sing While You're Crying Is So Brave.


Believe in your infinite potential. Your only limitations are those you set upon yourself.

If something burns your soul with purpose and desire, it's your duty to be reduced to ashes by it. Any other form of existence will be yet another dull book in the library of life.


If [you're asked] what you think, tell. If you have a preference, voice it. If you have a question, ask it. If you want to cry, bawl. If you need help, raise your hand and jump up and down.


Your guardian angel never, ever stops communicating with you.

Then that's what the Northern Lights are. All the lives that we're not living.


We all get lots of people. And maybe we don't always get to have them the exact way we want them, but if we can figure out a way to compromise, you know, then we can keep them all.


I leave pansies, the symbolic flower of freethought, in memory of the Great Agnostic,

If you always attach positive emotions to the things you want, and never attach negative emotions to the things you don't, then that which you desire most will invariably come your way.


The moon will guide you through the night with her brightness, but she will always dwell in the darkness, in order to be seen.


I believe that you're great, that there's something magnificent about you. Regardless of what has happened to you in your life, regardless of how young or how old you think you might be, the moment you begin to think properly, there's something that is within you, there's power within you, that's greater than the world. It will begin to emerge. It will take over your life. It will feed you. It will clothe you. It will guide you, protect you, direct you, sustain your very existence, if you let it. Now, that is what I know for sure.


Never curse a fall. The ground is where humility lives.


‎You shouldn't feel so bad about being afraid of so many things. Why not? Because if you weren't afraid never ever, then you couldn't be brave never ever.


Failure is a greater teacher than success


He who is best prepared can best serve his moment of inspiration.


If you only write when inspired, you may be a fairly decent poet, but you'll never be a novelist.

Too many people are too busy making a living to make a life.


Amateurs look for inspiration; the rest of us just get up and go to work.


Moods can be contagious. Don't catch or spread a bad mood.


God himself, finding he was in the midst of spirits and glory, because he was more intelligent, saw proper to institute laws whereby the rest could have a privilege to advance like himself. The relationship we have with God places us in a situation to advance in knowledge. He has power to institute laws to instruct the weaker intelligences, that they may be exalted with Himself, so that they might have one glory upon another, and all that knowledge, power, glory, and intelligence, which is requisite in order to save them in the world of spirits. (King Follett Discourse)


Strength comes from struggle. When you learn to see your struggles as opportunities to become stronger, better, wiser, then your thinking shifts from I can't do this to I must do this.


Inspiration is what keeps us well.


Men love women who are courageous for it means they can go all the way with him in his pursuit of his good dreams and intentions.


Inspirations never go in for long engagements; they demand immediate marriage to action.


Sounds travel through space long after their wave patterns have ceased to be detectable by the human ear: some cut right through the ionosphere and barrel on out into the cosmic heartland, while others bounce around, eventually being absorbed into the vibratory fields of earthly barriers, but in neither case does the energy succumb; it goes on forever - which is why we, each of us, should take pains to make sweet notes.

Action creates/a taste/for itself.


Roam abroad in the world, and take thy fill of its enjoyments before the day shall come when thou must quit it for good.


How soon country people forget. When they fall in love with a city it is forever, and it is like forever. As though there never was a time when they didn't love it. The minute they arrive at the train station or get off the ferry and glimpse the wide streets and the wasteful lamps lighting them, they know they are born for it. There, in a city, they are not so much new as themselves: their stronger, riskier selves.


Every production of an artist should be the expression of an adventure of his soul.


To live long and achieve happiness, cultivate the art of radiating happiness.


One does not surrender a life in an instant. That which is lifelong can only be surrendered in a lifetime.


Anyone who is having troubles should pray. Anyone who is happy should sing praises. Anyone who is sick should call the church's elders. They should pray for and pour oil on the person in the name of the Lord. And the prayer that is said with faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will heal that person. And if the person has sinned, the sins will be forgiven. Confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so God can heal you. When a believing person prays, great things happen. (James 5:13-16)


Think of yourself as a brand. You need to be remembered. What will they remember you for? What defines you? If you have it in you, do something that defines you. Invent something, develop a unique skill, get noticed for something  it creates a talking point.


If you want to concentrate deeply on some problem, and especially some piece of writing or paper-work, you should acquire a cat. Alone with the cat in the room where you work ... the cat will invariably get up on your desk and settle placidly under the desk lamp ... The cat will settle down and be serene, with a serenity that passes all understanding. And the tranquility of the cat will gradually come to affect you, sitting there at your desk, so that all the excitable qualities that impede your concentration compose themselves and give your mind back the self-command it has lost. You need not watch the cat all the time. Its presence alone is enough. The effect of a cat on your concentration is remarkable, very mysterious.


They may try to stop you by their words and deeds, but like air you will rise above it all. You are unstoppable


Don't you know no one can escape

I'm not saying that you should deny the difficult events of your life. But the fact that you survived is also a wonderful story to tell. And that story, the story of the way you came through a difficult situation, found resources within yourself or outside of yourself, gleaned from that experience what you wanted and what you didn't want going forward  that is a story that can inspire you and others to heal and grow.


Boredom is the fear of self.


You can't hide the thunderbolt. When it hits you, everybody can see it. Christ, man, don't be ashamed of it, some men pray for the thunderbolt. You're a very lucky fellow. - Calo


Discipline your mind to see the good in every situation and look on the best side of every event.

Maturity is when you stop complaining and making excuses in your life; you realize everything that happens in life is a result of the previous choice you've made and start making new choices to change your life.


Which road, which road did you take

If you really want to be a writer, nobody can stop you -- and if you don't, nobody can help you.


Whatever choice you make makes you. Choose wisely.

Just start the sentence...and see what happens. This is how we write.


I'm sure it is, she replied. Her expression turned fierce, making her look far different from the scattered teacher I knew.

The comfort zone is a psychological state in which one feels familiar, safe, at ease, and secure.

What you have learned from experience is worth much more than gold. If you have a house it may burn down. Any kind of possession can be lost, but your experience is yours forever. Keep it and find a way to use it.


Dream big. Wake up. Take the first step into the unknown.


I could taste the salt on her lips, each kiss like a summer wave breaking on an empty beach.


When you start giving, instead of getting, you make a difference. You can always give a warm smile, a sincere hello, a positive vibe... your attention, your time, your love, and kindness to those around you.


We can be friends. We can be anything we want to be.


When you open your mind, you open new doors to new possibilities for yourself and new opportunities to help others.


The mind travels faster than the pen; consequently, writing becomes a question of learning to make occasional wing shots, bringing down the bird of thought as it flashes by. A writer is a gunner, sometimes waiting in the blind for something to come in, sometimes roaming the countryside hoping to scare something up.


The beginning is always NOW.


Not even waste/is inviolate./The day misspent,/the love misplaced,/has inside it/the seed of redemption./Nothing is exempt from resurrection.


The restless spirit never loses its wings. If sometimes it cannot fly, it is because during those moments the sky vanishes.


A Manifesto for Introverts

There is no tomorrow and there was no yesterday; if you truly want to accomplish your goals you must engulf yourself in today.


Love is forgiving, accepting, moving on, embracing, and all encompassing. And if you're not doing that for yourself, you cannot do that with anyone else.


I want to be the best version of myself for anyone who is going to someday walk into my life and need someone to love them beyond reason.


How quick and rushing life can sometimes seem, when at the same time it's so slow and sweet and everlasting.


I decided that it was not wisdom that enabled [poets] to write their poetry, but a kind of instinct or inspiration, such as you find in seers and prophets who deliver all their sublime messages without knowing in the least what they mean.


Occasionally, there arises a writing situation where you see an alternative to what you are doing, a mad, wild gamble of a way for handling something, which may leave you looking stupid, ridiculous or brilliant -you just don't know which. You can play it safe there, too, and proceed along the route you'd mapped out for yourself. Or you can trust your personal demon who delivered that crazy idea in the first place.

Take responsibility for your own happiness, do not expect people or things to bring you happiness, or you could be disappointed.


Chapter One of My Life. I walk down the street. There's a deep hole in the sidewalk. I fall in.

God takes away the minds of poets, and uses them as his ministers, as he also uses diviners and holy prophets, in order that we who hear them may know them to be speaking not of themselves who utter these priceless words in a state of unconsciousness, but that God himself is the speaker, and that through them he is conversing with us.


I imagine what would happen if everyone turned their regrets into wishes, went around shouting them.


To only responsible choice I can make is to be love and happiness. Vincellent

Read deeply. Stay open. Continue to wonder.


Maybe we all just exist, all versions of us exist at times, and we have to figure out a way to get to each of them, to find each one and tell that version that it's okay, that it's all justthe way it works, a concept too powerful to ignore but too complicated to explain.


When you walk a life of honesty, you live a life of truth.


I think music is what language once aspired to be. Music allows us to face God on our own terms because it reaches beyond life.


Bill Gates (and his successor at Microsoft, Ray Ozzie) are famous for taking annual reading vacations. During the year they deliberately cultivate a stack of reading materialmuch of it unrelated to their day-to-day focus at Microsoftand then they take off for a week or two and do a deep dive into the words they've stockpiled. By compressing their intake into a matter of days, they give new ideas additional opportunities to network among themselves, for the simple reason that it's easier to remember something that you read yesterday than it is to remember something you read six months ago.


I told him I had once lost everything I had, too, and that I think that can be God's way of building walls around us to force us to look up at Him.


Who dares, win


Doubt not, O poet, but persist. Say 'It is in me, and shall out.' Stand there, balked and dumb, stuttering and stammering, hissed and hooted, stand and strive, until at last rage draw out of thee that dream-power which every night shows thee is thine own; a power transcending all limit and privacy, and by virtue of which a man is the conductor of the whole river of electricity.


Bad, or good, as it happens to be, that is what it is to exist! . . . It is as though I have been silent and fuddled with sleep all my life. In spite of all, I know now that at least it is better to go always towards the summer, towards those burning seas of light; to sit at night in the forecastle lost in an unfamiliar dream, when the spirit becomes filled with stars, instead of wounds, and good and compassionate and tender. To sail into an unknown spring, or receive one's baptism on storm's promontory, where the solitary albatross heels over in the gale, and at last come to land. To know the earth under one's foot and go, in wild delight, ways where there is water.


I'm not out to compete with any one, I'm here to complete, by encouraging and inspiring souls through a text at a time


Mary Queen of Scots had a little dog, a Skye terrier, that was devoted to her. Moments after Mary was beheaded, the people who were watching saw her skirts moving about and they thought her headless body was trying to get itself to its feet. But the movement turned out to be her dog, which she had carried to the block with her, hidden in her skirts. Mary Stuart is supposed to have faced her execution with grace and courage (she wore a scarlet chemise to suggest she was being martyred), but I don't think she could have been so brave if she had not secretly been holding tight to her Skye terrier, feeling his warm, silky fur against her trembling skin.


Be like a postage stamp. Stick to it until you get there


The tension between what is, and what we dream of, is important. Not to discount what we have, but to hold onto that middle ground, because it's in there that the magic happens.


Josh had told me a long time ago that he had this theory that an entire relationship was based on what occurred over the course of the first five minutes you know each other. That everything that came after those first minutes was just details being filled in. Meaning: you already knew how deep the love was, how instinctually you felt about someone.

All my problems bow before my stubbornness.


Fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge. Only Fools despise wisdom and discipline.

Intelligence is more important than strength, that is why earth is ruled by men and not by animals.


When you are angry try your best to go to sleep, it keeps you away from speaking, writing and thinking while you are angry.


Doing what you wanted to do was the only training, and the only preliminary, needed for doing more of what you wanted to do.


The world's greatest achievers have been those who have always stayed focussed on their goals and have been consistent in their efforts.


You have come to earth to entertain and to be entertained.


Saw a little girl touch a big bug and shout, I conquered my fear! YES! and calmly walk away. I was inspired.


You never know when the truth will come home. You can't choose the time. The time chooses you.


Buddha had said:

Accepting personal responsibility for your life frees you from outside influences – increases your self-esteem – boosts confidence in your ability to decisions – and ultimately leads to achieve success in life.


The death of a dream can in fact serve as the vehicle that endows it with new form, with reinvigorated substance, a fresh flow of ideas, and splendidly revitalized color. In short, the power of a certain kind of dream is such that death need not indicate finality at all but rather signify a metaphysical and metaphorical leap forward.


Without inspiration, we're all like a box of matches that will never be lit.


No man is happy without a delusion of some kind. Delusions are as necessary to our happiness as realities.


It is not possible to know how far the influence of any amiable, honest-hearted duty-doing man flies out into the world, but it is very possible to know how it has touched one's self in going by.


Remember that the happiest people are not those getting more, but those giving more.


Generasi kempong tidak punya waktu dan tidak memiliki tradisi untuk tahu beda antara kalimat sindiran dengan bukan sindiran. Tak tahu apa itu ironi, sarkasme, sanepan, istidraj ... Generasi kempong sangat rentan terhadap apa saja, termasuk informasi ... Tidak ada etos kerja. Tidak ada ideologi dharma, atau falya'mal 'amalan shalihan ... Yang dipunyai hanya obsesi hasil, khayal kepemilikan dan kenikmatan.


The really magical things are the ones that happen right in front of you. A lot of the time you keep looking for beauty, but it is already there. And if you look with a bit more intention, you see it.


YOU. ARE. PERFECT. You are. Im talking to YOU. and dont you dare think otherwise...embrace the entity of yourself...you are a puzzle piece and you are meant to be puzzling.


Come to the edge.

No one rises above who he or she has been without first having fallen down. The best time - in fact, the only time - to make a real change in your life is in the moment of seeing the need for it. He who hesitates always gets lost in the hundred reasons why tomorrow is a better day to get started.


Play to win, not not to lose.


They say what doesn't kill the soul will make you stronger, but you can't be a stone-hearted man.


Do not waste the vast majority of your life doing something you hate so that you can spend the small remainder sliver of your life in modest comfort. You may never reach that end anyway.

If I do not know the will of my Father, and what He requires of me in a certain transaction, if I ask Him to give me wisdom concerning any requirement in my life, or in regard to my own course, or that of my friends, my family, my children, or those that I preside over, and get no answer from Him, and then do the very best that my judgement will teach me, He is bound to own and honor that transaction, and He will do so to all intents and purposes.


It is not merely enough to love literature if one wishes to spend one's life as a writer. It is a dangerous undertaking on the most primitive level. For, it seems to me, the act of writing with serious intent involves enormous personal risk. It entails the ongoing courage for self-discovery. It means one will walk forever on the tightrope, with each new step presenting the possiblity of learning a truth about oneself that is too terrible to bear.


If you are a Buddhist, inspire yourself by thinking of the bodhisattva. If you are a Christian, think of the Christ, who came not to be served by others but to serve them in joy, in peace, and in generosity. For these things, these are not mere words, but acts, which go all the way, right up to their last breath. Even their death is a gift, and resurrection is born from this kind of death. (157)


It's often a matter of sitting in front of the computer and worrying. It's what writing comes down to--worrying that things aren't going to work out.


True beauty radiates not from outer cosmetics, but from the simple joy of making a difference for those that need your voice, passion, and time without expecting or wanting anything in return...


You can close your eyes to the things you don't want to see, but you can't close your heart to the things you don't want to feel.


If 'seeing is believing' what happened to taste, touch, sound and smell ? Did our creator really intend to favour sight over the other senses ? I don't believe so.


God is not interested in your art but, your heart.


A too closely watched flower/blossoms the wrong color./Excess attention to the jonquil/turns it gentian. Flowers/need it tranquil to get/their hues right. Some/only open at midnight.


Inhale when I inhale. Exhale when I exhale. Breathe with me,for two beating hearts breathing one breath together become one.


To study and constantly, is this not a pleasure? To have friends come from far away places, is this not a joy? If people do not recognize your worth, but this does not worry you, are you not a true gentleman?


Writing is.... being able to take something whole and fiercely alive that exists inside you in some unknowable combination of thought, feeling, physicality, and spirit, and to then store it like a genie in tense, tiny black symbols on a calm white page. If the wrong reader comes across the words, they will remain just words. But for the right readers, your vision blooms off the page and is absorbed into their minds like smoke, where it will re-form, whole and alive, fully adapted to its new environment.


He glanced back at the wall. How like a mirror, too, her face. Impossible; for how many people did you know who reflected your own light to you? People were more often--he searched for a simile, found one in his work--torches, blazing away until they whiffed out. How rarely did other people's faces take of you and throw back to you your own expression, your own innermost trembling thought?


I know too well how dangerous hope can be, how it grows and sometimes dies, taking its host with it. It's more powerful than anything Dr.Fibs keeps in his labs, more precious than all the secrets inside Sublevel Two.


The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated. I hold that the more helpless a creature the more entitled it is to protection by man from the cruelty of humankind.


Everything you need is already within you. The beauty of life is that your DESTINY lies always in your hands. The time has come for you to STEP UP and BE GREAT


Don't waste time waiting for inspiration. Begin, and inspiration will find you.


won't you celebrate with me

Reading, conversation, environment, culture, heroes, mentors, nature – all are lottery tickets for creativity. Scratch away at them and you'll find out how big a prize you've won.


I was kind of excited to go to jail for the first time and I learnt some great dialogue.


If you believe in your heart that you are right, then you must fight with all your might to do it your way. Only dead fish swim with the stream all the time.


The Prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel dined with me, and I asked them how they dared so roundly to assert, that God spoke to them; and whether they did not think at the time, that they would be misunderstood, & so be the cause of imposition.

[B]riefing is not reading. In fact it is the antithesis of reading. Briefing is terse, factual and to the point. Reading is untidy, discursive and perpetually inviting. Briefing closes down a subject, reading opens it up.


Starting over can be the scariest thing in the entire world, whether it's leaving a lover, a school, a team, a friend or anything else that feels like a core part of our identity but when your gut is telling you that something here isn't right or feels unsafe, I really want you to listen and trust in that voice.


Step out of your comfort zone. Comfort zones, where your unrealized dreams are buried, are the enemies of achievement. Leadership begins when you step outside your comfort zone.


Don't ever ask for permission to follow your dreams. Follow them no matter fucking what. It's important. We have one life here and you are the author of your story, more than anybody else. You are much more responsible for your dreams coming true or not than anyone else in your life you have contacted with. So, dream big, work hard, and make it happen no matter what.


No sooner have you feasted on beauty with your eyes than your mind tells you that beauty is vain and beauty passes


Steal from anywhere that resonates with inspiration or fuels your imagination. Devour old films, new film, music, books, paintings, photographs, poems, dreams, random conversations, architecture, bridges, street signs, trees, clouds, bodies of water, light and shadows. Select only things to steal from that speak directly to your soul.


It's time we capture our imaginations for Christ


Your hardest times often lead to the greatest moments of your life. Keep going. Tough situations build strong people in the end.


I started out of course with Hemingway when I learned how to write. Until I realized Hemingway doesn't have a sense of humor. He never has anything funny in his stories.


Be With Me In The Phases Of My Work Because My Brain Feels Like It Has Been Whipped And I Yearn To Make A Small Perfect Thing Which Will Live In Your Morning Like Curious Static Through A President's Elegy Or A Nude Hunchback Acquiring A Tan On The Crowded Oily Beach.


To be taught to readwhat is the use of that, if you know not whether what you read is false or true? To be taught to write or to speakbut what is the use of speaking, if you have nothing to say? To be taught to thinknay, what is the use of being able to think, if you have nothing to think of? But to be taught to see is to gain word and thought at once, and both true.


Believe in yourself, your abilities and your own potential. Never let self-doubt hold you captive. You are worthy of all that you dream of and hope for.


That's what being alive is, Thing! It's being badly prepared for everything! Because you only get one chance, Thing!


Forgetting takes space./Forgotten matters displace/as much anything else as/anything else. We must/skirt unlabeled crates/as thought it made sense/and take them when we go/to other states.


I'm interested in the way in which the past affects the present and I think that if we understand a good deal more about history, we automatically understand a great more about contemporary life.

If the people of Europe had known as much of astronomy and geology when the bible was introduced among them, as they do now, there never could have been one believer in the doctrine of inspiration. If the writers of the various parts of the bible had known as much about the sciences as is now known by every intelligent man, the book never could have been written. It was produced by ignorance, and has been believed and defended by its author. It has lost power in the proportion that man has gained knowledge. A few years ago, this book was appealed to in the settlement of all scientific questions; but now, even the clergy confess that in such matters, it has ceased to speak with the voice of authority. For the establishment of facts, the word of man is now considered far better than the word of God. In the world of science, Jehovah was superseded by Copernicus, Galileo, and Kepler. All that God told Moses, admitting the entire account to be true, is dust and ashes compared to the discoveries of Descartes, Laplace, and Humboldt. In matters of fact, the bible has ceased to be regarded as a standard. Science has succeeded in breaking the chains of theology. A few years ago, Science endeavored to show that it was not inconsistent with the bible. The tables have been turned, and now, Religion is endeavoring to prove that the bible is not inconsistent with Science. The standard has been changed.


All humanity is one undivided and indivisible family. I cannot detach myself from the wickedest soul.


Birth, life, and death― each took place on the hidden side of a leaf.


A bridge of silver wings stretches from the dead ashes of an unforgiving nightmare

I am not a little bit of many things; but I am the sufficient representation of many things. I am not an incompletion of all these races; but I am a masterpiece of the prolific. I am an entirety, I am not a lack of anything; rather I am a whole of many things. God did not see it needful to make me generic. He thinks I am better than that.


It is never too late to turn on the light. Your ability to break an unhealthy habit or turn off an old tape doesn't depend on how long it has been running; a shift in perspective doesn't depend on how long you've held on to the old view.

Oh what a wonderful soul so bright inside you. Got power to heal the sun's broken heart, power to restore the moon's vision too.


‎What does it mean if you tried to get somewhere, and you didn't? Like what? Like if you were trying to get somewhere, but you couldn't find it?

Each person you meet

It isn't the happy ending Ingrid and I had dreamed up, but it's all a part of what I'm working through. The way life changes. The way people and things disappear. Then appear, unexpectedly, and hold you close.


Do you really believe in destiny? How can I not believe in destiny, when there is no difference between my memories and my dreams at night? There's no difference between their reality. And if I dream something first, I remember it later when I am actually walking in the place or looking at the person I first dreamed of. Days later. Or years later. Destiny~ she walks with me.


If you're reading these words, perhaps it's because something has kicked open the door for you, and you're ready to embrace change. It isn't enough to appreciate change from afar, or only in the abstract, or as something that can happen to other people but not to you. We need to create change for ourselves, in a workable way, as part of our everyday lives.


When I left Queen's my future seemed to stretch out before me like a straight road. I thought I could see along it for many a milestone. Now there is a bend in it. I don't know what lies around the bend, but I am going to believe that the best does. It has a fascination of its own, that bend, Marilla. I wonder how the road beyond it goes - what there is of green glory and soft, checkered light and shadows - what new landscapes - what new beauties - what curves and hills and valleys farther on.


For the poet is a light and winged and holy thing, and there is no invention in him until he has been inspired and is out of his senses, and the mind is no longer in him: when he has not attained to this state, he is powerless and is unable to utter his oracles.


Everything in creation has its appointed painter or poet and remains in bondage like the princess in the fairy tale 'til its appropriate liberator comes to set it free.


but I have no mind for business and considered staying awake to be enough of an accomplishment.


What in hell are you really made of, Howard? After all, it's only a building. It's not the combination of holy sacrament, Indian torture, and sexual ecstasy that you seem to make of it.

The most dangerous irony is, people are angry with others because of their own incompetence.


The words were unexpected, but so incisively true. So much of prayer is like that - an encounter with a truth that has sunk to the bottom of the heart, that wants to be found, wants to be spoken, wants to be elevated into the realm of sacredness.


The youth gets together his materials to build a bridge to the moon, or, perchance, a palace or temple on the earth, and, at length, the middle-aged man concludes to build a woodshed with them.


Even after the stormiest weather, a true warrior will still reflect the brilliant rays of the magnificent sun through both his or her eyes. You may get hit by sudden lighting or take severe beatings from the cruel wind, but you will always get back up and stand strong on your feet again, soak in the sunlight, and be prepared to get hit by even the most merciless hail - time and time again.


Someday stars will wind down or blow up. Someday death will cover us all like the water of a lake and perhaps nothing will ever come to the surface to show that we were ever there. But we WERE there, and during the time we lived, we were alive. That's the truth - what is, what was, what will be - not what could be, what should have been, what never can be.


But yield who will to their separation,

MANAGE YOUR MOOD: Name 1 thing that surprised you today...Name 1 thing that moved you...Name 1 thing that inspired you...


Maturity is when you stop complaining and making excuses in your life; you realize everything that happens in life is a result of the previous choice you've made and start making new choices to change your life.


Facing your fears robs them of their power


The greenest of pastures are right here on earth.


I ran across an excerpt today (in English translation) of some dialogue/narration from the modern popular writer, Paulo Coelho in his book: Aleph.(Note: bracketed text is mine.)... 'I spoke to three scholars,' [the character says 'at last.'] ...two of them said that, after death, the [sic (misprint, fault of the publisher)] just go to Paradise. The third one, though, told me to consult some verses from the Koran. [end quote]' ...I can see that he's excited. [narrator]' ...Now I have many positive things to say about Coelho: He is respectable, inspiring as a man, a truth-seeker, and an appealing writer; but one should hesitate to call him a 'literary' writer based on this quote. A 'literary' author knows that a character's excitement should be 'shown' in his or her dialogue and not in the narrator's commentary on it. Advice for Coelho: Remove the 'I can see that he's excited' sentence and show his excitement in the phrasing of his quote.(Now, in defense of Coelho, I am firmly of the opinion, having myself written plenty of prose that is flawed, that a novelist should be forgiven for slipping here and there.)Lastly, it appears that a belief in reincarnation is of great interest to Mr. Coelho ... Just think! He is a man who has achieved, (as Leonard Cohen would call it), 'a remote human possibility.' He has won lots of fame and tons of money. And yet, how his preoccupation with reincarnationnone other than an interest in being born again as somebody elsesuggests that he is not happy!

Being a role model is the most powerful form of educating...too often fathers neglect it because they get so caught up in making a living they forget to make a life.


The more you can have control over your ego rather than let it run amuck, the more successful you'll be in all areas of life.


whatever you do

Think of what starlight

I woke up early and took the first train to take me away from the city. The noise and all its people. I was alone on the train and had no idea where I was going, and that's why I went there. Two hours later we arrived in a small town, one of those towns with one single coffee shop and where everyone knows each other's name. I walked for a while until I found the water, the most peaceful place I know. There I sat and stayed the whole day, with nothing and everything on my mind, cleaning my head. Silence, I learned, is some times the most beautiful sound.


Silence

I try hard not to judge anyone, and I try to bless everyone who is a part of my life, particularly anyone with whom I am having any problems

The dream is to keep surprising yourself, never mind the audience.


Notice the difference between being in control and needing control.


So, the world is fine. We don't have to save the worldthe world is big enough to look after itself. What we have to be concerned about, is whether or not the world we live in, will be capable of sustaining us in it. That's what we need to think about.


And now we step to the rhythm of miracles.

I'm pretty much looking for beauty all the time. It just seems like some days the light is better to see it.


Coincidences give you opportunities to look more deeply into your existence.


We make our own truths and lies....Truths are often lies and lies truths...


Optimists enrich the present, enhance the future,challenge the improbable and attain the impossible


There will be another sky, my love, just you wait


The ball laughs, radiant, in the air. He brings her down, puts her to sleep, showers her with compliments, dances with her, and seeing such things never before seen his admirers pity their unborn grandchildren who will never see them.


It is only by risking our persons from one hour to another that we live at all.


There's nothing half so sweet in life as love's young dream.


If I don't eat junk, I don't gain weight.


GIVING - Applied tithing is so rewarding. When you give away your time, talent, and treasures you create a huge shift in your prosperity consciousness. So start where you are as you reach for where it is you want to be.


Luck? I don't know anything about luck. I've never banked on it and I'm afraid of people who do. Luck to me is something else: hard work - and realizing what opportunity is and what isn't.


Astraeus,' Aven called out. 'God of the four winds and friend to sailors. Say a little prayer when you look at him, so he will give us what we need to keep our course.'

Belief isn't supposed to make sense, at least not all the time. In that, it finds its power. It gets to creep up on you and carry you forward. Until you can carry yourself again.


This is the story of how Dad lived with his lung cancer. But it is much more. Through his illness and the miracles we experienced, I came to see that Dad's was not just a journey. It was a journey home. Home to God.

If you seek creative ideas go walking.

there is one great truth on this planet: whoever you are, or whatever it is that you do, when you really want something, it's because that desire originated in the soul of the universe. It's your mission on earth.


(W)hat I write when I force myself is generally just as good as what I write when I'm feeling inspired. It's mainly a matter of forcing yourself to write.


People will always notice something about you. It might be the way you walk or the way you talk, or just simply your personality. Live each day in the way you want to be remembered.

Hotel rooms inhabit a separate moral universe.


Life is now in session. Are you present?


Our hearts resonate at the same frequency as the earth and the universe. Therefore, we are all valuable instruments in the orchestration of the world and its harmony. We must always be aware of the vibrations we emit individually and collectively. Always be in command of your music. Only you can control and shape its tone. If life throws you a few bad notes or vibrations, don't let them interrupt or alter your song.


...we have to surpass ourselves every day, make every day undying. Climb our own personal Everest and do it in such a way that every step is a little bit of eternity.

For the most part wisdom comes in chips rather than blocks. You have to be willing to gather them constantly, and from sources you never imagined to be probable. No one chip gives you the answer for everything. No one chip stays in the same place throughout your entire life. The secret is to keep adding voices, adding ideas, and moving things around as you put together your life. If you're lucky, putting together your life is a process that will last through every single day you're alive.


Forbearance in the face of fate, beauty constant under torture, are not merely passive. They are a positive achievement, an explicit triumph.

Someone once told me that the finer points of devotion are about the size of a pinhole, and there are millions of them. And if you could connect each dot, then you've got a diagram of what you think you thought you knew, and if you're willing to admit that you know nothing...you have the blueprint for a breakthrough.


Doubt is a question mark; faith is an exclamation point. The most compelling, believable, realistic stories have included them both.


I look out into the water and up deep into the stars. I beg the sparkling lanterns of light to cure me of myself  my past and the kaleidoscope of mistakes, failures and wrong turns that have stacked unbearable regret upon my shoulders.


I've come to realize that sometimes, what you love most is what you have to fight the hardest to keep.


There is no duty we so much underrate as the duty of being happy.


The more invested I am in my own ideas about reality, the more those experiences will feel like victimizations rather than the ups and downs of relating. Actually, I believe that the less I conceptualize things that way, the more likely it is that people will want to stay by me, because they will not feel burdened, consciously or unconsciously, by my projections, judgments, entitlements, or unrealistic expectations.


When you are lonely for a while don't get restless, if you had born alone, you are going to die alone then for sometime you can certainly live alone.


... a good idea always attracts other good ideas.


When true happiness shows up, the ego is bored with it: It's too plain, too ordinary, and it doesn't leave us feeling special or above the fray. It doesn't take away our problems, which is the ego's idea of happiness. The ego wants no more difficulties: no ore sickness, no more need for money, no more work, no more bad feelings, only unending pleasure and bliss. Such perfection is the ego's idea of a successful life. However, the happiness the ego dreams of will never be attained by anyone. The ego denies the reality of this dimension, where challenges are necessary to evolution and blissful states and pleasure come and go.


Does our purpose on Earth directly link to the people whom we end up meeting? Are our relationships and experiences actually the required dots that connect and then lead us to our ultimate destinies?


Everyone wants a prodigy to fail; it makes our mediocrity more bearable.


I called the world of phenomena an illusion, I called my eyes and my tongue and accident, valueless phenomena. No, that is all over; I have awakened, I have really awakened and have just been born today.


Until one is committed there is hesitancy, the chance to draw back, always ineffectiveness. Concerning all acts of initative or creation, there is one elementary truth...that the moment one definitely commits oneself, then Providence moves. too. All sorts of things occur to help one that would otherwise never have occurred. A whole stream of events issues from the decision, raising in ones's favor all manner of incidents and meetings and material assistance which no man would have believed would have come his way.

Your life is a movie. You are the main character. You say your scripts and act to your lines. Of course you do your lines in each scene. There is a hidden camera and a director who you can ask for help anytime up above.


Your husband may not be a wealth of pregnancy information, but he is a wealth of 'you' information. He probably knows you better than anyone else in this world (which means he understands your current neediness pretty well). He also probably loves you more than anyone else in this world. So, while he may not be the person to turn to if you need to know how to soothe breast tenderness, he's the perfect person to turn to when you need a hand to hold.


An average man is egoistic, proud and has strong self esteem. They always require partners who massage their ego not those who will drag their ego to the mud.


Music is the beat of a drum that keeps time with our emotions.


There is no secret ingredient


Sometimes we have to soak ourselves in the tears and fears of the past to water our future gardens.


So the next time you see a person with a compose face and a soft voice, remember that inside her mind she might be solving an equation, composing a sonnet, designing a hat. She might, that is, be deploying the powers of quiet.


But God decided to create a world where free will was more important than no one ever getting hurt. There must be something stunningly beautiful and remarkable about free will that only God can truly grasp, because God hates, literally abhors, evil, yet He created a world where evil could happen if people chose it.


Be brave enough to live the life of your dreams according to your vision and purpose instead of the expectations and opinions of others.


Personally, I wouldn't wait around for someone to tell you you're good enough before you make your own comics. Just make them, always try to improve and care about what you're doing. Be relentless and never give up.


Concerning the popularity of vampire books:

Malander had an idea and was trying to work it out, but it would take him time. Sometimes people never saw things clearly until it was too late and they no longer had the strength to start again. Or else they forgot their idea along the way and didn't even realise that they forgotten.


You're the only one that can put pressure on yourself... No one else can put pressure on you. It's self-inflicted. For me, I just want to go out and play football.


The more you feed your mind with positive thoughts, the more you can attract great things into your life.


Distance yourself from negative people who try to lower your motivation and decrease your ambition. Create space for positive people to come into your life. Surround yourself with positive people who believe in your dreams, encourage your ideas, support your ambitions, and bring out the best in you.


Marijuana enhances our mind in a way that enables us to take a different perspective from 'high up', to see and evaluate our own lives and the lives of others in a privileged way. Maybe this euphoric and elevating feeling of the ability to step outside

Just above our terror, the stars painted this story

I am writing in the garden. To write as one should of a garden one must write not outside it or merely somewhere near it, but in the garden.


All you have to do is put one word after another, and remember how great it feels to be a writer.


And one fine day the goddess of the wind kisses the foot of man, that mistreated, scorned foot, and from that kiss the soccer idol is born. He is born in a straw crib in a tin-roofed shack and he enters the world clinging to a ball.


Once you have met someone, you never really forget them.


I'm not a big fan of inspiration. I'm too old to sit and wait for the muse to give me a little kiss... I write a lot, and I'm not afraid to make mistakes or to write badly. I can alsways fix something weak and dull. But I can't fix a blank page.


To recognize that the greatest error is not to have tried and failed, but that in trying, we did not give it our best effort


When Suzie introduced Helen, she told the audience that one of the best things about books is that they are an interactive art form: that while the author may describe in some detail how a character looks, it is the reader's imagination that completes the image, making it his or her own. That's why we so often don't like movies made from books, right? Suzie said. We don't like someone else's interpretation of what we see so clearly. She talked, too, about how books educate and inspire, and how they soothe the soul-like comfort food without the calories, she said. She talked about the tactile joys of reading, the feel of a page beneath one's fingers; the elegance of typeface on a page. She talked about how people complain that they don't have time to read, and reminded them that if they gave up half an hour of television a day in favor of reading, they could finish twenty-five books a year. Books don't take time away from us, she said. They give it back. In this age of abstraction, of multitasking, of speed for speed's sake, they reintroduce us to the elegance-and the relief!-of real, tick-tock time.


Rise early and seize each day, learn much and use this knowledge well, spend time with those you love, never abuse your pets, use logic to fight the irrational (for it is everywhere), defend the environment and its wildlife as a knight would protect King Arthur, meld mind and heart for greatest creativity, follow your dreams, and become all that you can be.


File under Hard Truths: the creative muse is fiction. If you sit around waiting for the right moment to create, you will die waiting.


I've stripped my life down, he told me. I don't need much. I have all the company I want to keep right in here. He shot himself in the head with his fingers. People don't understand about the need to live simply. They make appointments all day. They even schedule their own deaths. The first time they'll have freedom to really be themselves is when they no longer exist. But up here, there's nothing but me and the sky. A million billion stars.


Using your talent, hobby or profession in a way that makes you contribute with something good to this world is truly the way to go.


To those peoples in the huts and villages of half the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery, we pledge our best efforts to help them help themselves, for whatever period is required - not because the Communists may be doing it, not because we seek their votes, but because it is right. If a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who are rich.


You don't have to stay trapped in your thoughts just because you think them.


Live a good life. More smiling, less worrying. More compassion, less judgment. More blessed, less stressed. More love, less hate.


There's this mental illness, right? It's called 'anhedonia.' It means 'without pleasure.' You can look it up, though all you really need to do is look around. She motioned to the door the other women had disappeared through, and to the world at large. A good deal of people, mostly women, spend their entire lives in this state. It's a sort of half-death. But if you recognize this, you can fix it...You focus on bliss. Small pleasures. Fill your day with as many as you can fit into twenty-four hours. You devote every possible moment not to fulfilling another person-a man-but yourself.-Suzanne

And so must learn to love with our mouths and voices, as well as with our eyes, flesh, heart, brains, and with everything we have, right down to our toenails. There is not anything about us that cannot love, and that is not called to love, and that is not destined to be turned, conformed, and reduced to pure love. It ...is the priceless deposit left by the burning away of selfishness.


Follow your heart, listen to your inner voice, stop caring what others think.


Maturity is when you stop complaining and making excuses, and start making changes.


The material world is all feminine. The feminine engergy makes the non-manifest, manifest. So even men (are of the feminine energy). We have to relinquish our ideas of gender in the conventional sense. This has nothing to do with gender, it has to do with energy. So feminine energy is what creates and allows anything which is non-manifest, like an idea, to come into form, into being, to be born. All that we experience in the world around us, absolutely everything (is feminine energy). The only way that anything exists is through the feminine force.


There are no tyrants if there are no slaves.


Instead of worrying about what you cannot control, shift your energy to what you can create.


Compassion is the key to the ultimate survival of our species.


Embrace being perfectly imperfect. Learn from your mistakes and forgive yourself, you'll be happier.


Optimists move through life with a happy exterior. What happens on the inside shows up on the outside.


Good things happen in your life when you surround yourself with positive people.


Unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall much be required.


Always remember people who have helped you along the way, and don't forget to lift someone up.




الناس يصرون علي رؤيتي علي صوره تخالف تماما ما أنا عليه و إنهم لن يروا أبدا في مكاني سوي الشخص الذي صاغوه لأنفسهم وشكلوه وفق هواهم ليكرهوه كما يشاءون ، و إذن فإنني أكون مخطئا لو أنني تأثرت من الطريقه التي يرونني بها إذ لا يجب أن أعيرها أي اهتمام حقيقي لأنني لست أنا من يرونه علي هذه الصوره!


No writing is wasted. Did you know that sourdough from San Francisco is leavened partly by a bacteria called lactobacillus sanfrancisensis? It is native to the soil there, and does not do well elsewhere. But any kitchen can become an ecosystem. If you bake a lot, your kitchen will become a happy home to wild yeasts, and all your bread will taste better. Even a failed loaf is not wasted. Likewise, cheese makers wash the dairy floor with whey. Tomato gardeners compost with rotten tomatoes. No writing is wasted: the words you can't put in your book can wash the floor, live in the soil, lurk around in the air. They will make the next words better.


When we feel unsafe with someone and still stay with him, we damage our ability to discern trustworthiness in those we will meet in the future.


The universe is made up of stories, not atoms.


An intelligent person, looking out of his eyes and hearkening in his ears, with a smile on his face all the time, will get more true education than many another in a life of heroic vigils.


Inspiration fires you up; motivation keeps you burning.


Calligraphy is a geometry of the soul which manifests itself physically.


When you give appreciation IN ORDER TO get something– it's manipulation and people can sense it. Appreciate genuinely.


Perfection is not a destination; it's a never-ending process...Enjoy!


Perseverance is the act of true role models and heroes.


At dawn of man, many words of inspiration.

Patience is the direct antithesis of anger.


My circumstances of unrelieved responsibility and permanent distraction necessitated the short story form.


Peace is not so much a political mandate as it is a shared state of consciousness that remains elevated and intact only to the degree that those who value it volunteer their existence as living examples of the same... Peace ends with the unraveling of individual hope and the emergence of the will to worship violence as a healer of private and social dis-ease.


I looked long and hard for the paper roses! I found the reddest red ribbon, and a little golden card! We were all there together, many of us, in the same place; but I was the only one who found the paper roses, the only one who chose the reddest red ribbon, and the only one who topped off with a golden card. And so I learned that if people are unhappy, it is only because they don't know how to look for the paper roses, they don't see the reddest red ribbon, and they don't like the little golden cards. We are all in the same wrap-shoppe in this life. But we are different. Because some of us are looking for the paper roses, choosing the reddest red ribbon, and picking up the little golden cards.


Every mother has to take care of her family.


Remember this, - where there is life there is hope. You're alive. Embrace this, because YOU CAN DO ANYTHING while there is breath in your body.


If the thought inspires you, and it feels good and right...it is yours, alone, to exercise. So get right on it!


Some women seem so voluptuous in every sense, richly bountiful and fertile with generous gifts of plenty, sensual and confident in their female strength that they are called earth mothers.

It is the kindness to take in a stranger when the levees break; the selflessness of workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job which sees us through our darkest hours. It is the firefighter's courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke, but also a parent's willingness to nurture a child, that finally decides our fate.


How do you even know I'm someone you'll want to remember? We've only seen each other once before.'

Doubt is a storm. We either ride it out, or we change our course. Neither is right or wrong--to stay or go. Twenty years ago, should you have really married X, or Y? This college, or that? A life-changing decision one makes becomes the right decision by the fact of simply having been made.


Shut up and write.


No matter how much you know, your destiny depends on the Wisdom, Knowledge and Understanding you display.


Give thanks for what you are today and go on fighting for what you gone be tomorrow


I said, but I have to go, there are so many places calling my name.


Falling in love with humans is like walking into a pantry and realizing you're trapped in it without Whip Cream, and Cherries.


Help others without any reason and give without the expectation of receiving anything in return.


If you have a strong purpose in life, you don't have to be pushed. Your passion will drive you there.


The poet is much more the one who inspires,than the one who is inspired.


Teachers have three loves: love of learning, love of learners, and the love of bringing the first two loves together.


88.	People wonder why so many writers come to live in Paris. I've been living ten years in Paris and the answer seems simple to me: because it's the best place to pick ideas. Just like Italy, Spain.. or Iran are the best places to pick saffron. If you want to pick opium poppies you go to Burma or South-East Asia. And if you want to pick novel ideas, you go to Paris.


Pippin glanced in some wonder at the face now close beside his own, for the sound of that laugh had been gay and merry. Yet in the wizard's face he saw at first only lines of care and sorrow; though as he looked more intently he perceived that under all there was a great joy: a fountain of mirth enough to set a kingdom laughing, were it to gush forth.


The greatest risk to man is not that he aims too high and misses, but that he aims too low and hits.


I hope I make people feel better. I hope I take people out of their situations a little bit and make them happier. That's really why I do what I do.


Dream your dream; and realize that you are more than just the dreamer, you are the point of origin for its reality.


To turn your dreams into reality, all your resources, efforts and concentration should be aligned in the same direction.


Every game is winnable if you change your mind about what the prize should be and your perspective about the players at the table.


THE FOUR HEAVENLY FOUNTAINS

I've grown up defined by this desperate, undeniable, 'can't breathe' kind of space inside of myself and I'm afraid that the diagnosis is fatal.


I fantasize the night sky to be like a cosmic blue print of my life as I close my eyes and unbutton my heart.... just in case anyone up there is listening.


excuse my enthusiasm or rather madness, for I am really drunk with intellectual vision whenever I take a pencil or graver into my hand.


Something, somewhere, knows what's best for me and promises to keep sending me people and experiences to light my way as long as I live in gratitude and keep paying attention to the signs.


Pay attention to the intricate patterns of your existence that you take for granted.


That is why enemies can be great motivators. They serve as fuel for your fire.


Being a Dream Girl is never going to be about what you look like or how much you weigh. After all, our physical appearances are just reflections of our inner worlds. What makes you a Dream Girl is your emotional sensitivity, your self-awareness, and your ability to communicate who you are effectively and compassionately in the world.


We are all too often told by someone that we are too old, too young, too different, too much the same, and those comments can be devastating.


Patience is a virtue not a vice.


Life's not the breaths you take, but the moments that take your breath away.


Accept yourself, love yourself, and keep moving forward.


Dreams link us to those who have already left this life.


Don't wait for things to happen. Make them happen.


Dreams. They start in your beautiful mind. Think of beautiful things and it will manifest into actions because your body will listen to you. Like it always does.


The only parts that really matter and take commitment in wedding vows are; worse, sickness and poorer. Better, richer and healthy is pretty easy to deal with.


You're the insane one. You don't even love the world you created. So how can you expect us to love and respect you?

Drama is based on the Mistake. I think someone is my friend when he really is my enemy, that I am free to marry a woman when in fact she is my mother, that this person is a chambermaid when it is a young nobleman in disguise, that this well-dressed young man is rich when he is really a penniless adventurer, or that if I do this such and such a result will follow when in fact it results in something very different. All good drama has two movements, first the making of the mistake, then the discovery that it was a mistake.


It's an enormous wall that's built between you and your dreams. And if every day, you just chip away... It may take ten years, but eventually you just might see some light.


إننا نربط أنفسنا - حين نصلي - بالقوة العظمى التي تهيمن على الكون، ونسألها ضارعين أن تمنحنا قبساً منها نستعين به على معاناة الحياة، بل إن الضراعة وحدها كفيلة بأن تزيد قوتنا ونشاطنا، ولن تجد احداً ضرع إلى الله مرة إلا عادت عليه هذه الضراعة بأحسن النتائج.


Every challenge, every adversity, contains within it the seeds of opportunity and growth.


Is it possible that the Pentateuch could not have been written by uninspired men? that the assistance of God was necessary to produce these books? Is it possible that

I believe the first draft of a book  even a long one  should take no more than three months...Any longer and  for me, at least  the story begins to take on an odd foreign feel, like a dispatch from the Romanian Department of Public Affairs, or something broadcast on high-band shortwave duiring a period of severe sunspot activity.


the joy that you give to others is the joy that comes back to you


I write only when inspiration strikes. Fortunately it strikes every morning at nine o'clock sharp.


For a true artist, difficulties become opportunities and clouds become solid present.


Formerly I believed books were made like this: a poet came, lightly opened his lips, and the inspired fool burst into song – if you please! But it seems, before they can launch a song, poets must tramp for days with callused feet, and the sluggish fish of the imagination flounders softly in the slush of the heart. And while, with twittering rhymes, they boil a broth of loves and nightingales, the tongueless street merely writhes for lack of something to shout or say


I didn't know I had it in me. There's more to all of us than we realize. Life is so much bigger, grander, higher, and wider than we allow ourselves to think. We're capable of so much more than we allow ourselves to believe.


Your father, Jo. He never loses patience,--never doubts or complains,--but always hopes, and works and waits so cheerfully, that one is ashamed to do otherwise before him. He helped and comforted me, and showed me that I must try to practise all the virtues I would have my little girls possess, for I was their example. It was easier for your sakes than for my own; a startled or surprised look from one of you, when I spoke sharply, rebuked me more than any words could have done; and the love, respect, and confidence of my children was the sweetest reward I could receive for my efforts to be the woman I would have them copy.


I realized that the good stories were affecting the organs of my body in various ways, and the really good ones were stimulating more than one organ. An effective story grabs your gut, tightens your throat, makes your heart race and your lungs pump, brings tears to your eyes or an explosion of laughter to your lips.


The opposite of interpersonal trust is not mistrust. It is despair. This is because we have given up on believing that trustworthiness and fulfillment are possible from others. We have lost our hope in our fellow humans.


You can dramatize your ideas in business or in any other aspect of your life. It's easy


In the very act of writing I felt pleased with what I did. There was the pleasure of having words come to me, and the pleasure of ordering them, re-ordering them, weighing one against another. Pleasure also in the imagination of the story, the feeling that it could mean something. Mostly I was glad to find out that I could write at all. In writing you work toward a result you won't see for years, and can't be sure you'll ever see. It takes stamina and self-mastery and faith. It demands those things of you, then gives them back with a little extra, a surprise to keep you coming. It toughens you and clears your head. I could feel it happening. I was saving my life with every word I wrote, and I knew it.


Every woman should see herself looking uniquely breathtaking, in something tailored to celebrate her body, so that she is better able to appreciate her own beauty and better equipped to withstand the ideals of our narrow-waisted, narrow- minded culture.


Evil does not exist; once you have crossed the threshold, all is good. Once in another world, you must hold your tongue.


There is no communication in this world except between equals.


If I never got to make a living doing what I loved, I'd still do it--for fun and for free.


This is your life – not your parents', teachers' or significant other's. If you ever find yourself on a path that just doesn't feel safe anymore, you have every right to stop the car, get out – change your shoes and start walking.


The king was silent. Ents! he said at length. Out of the shadows of legend I begin a little to understand the marvel of the trees, I think. I have lived to see strange days. Long we have tended our beasts and our fields, built our houses, wrought our tools, or ridden away to help in the wars of Minas Tirith. And that we called the life of Men, the way of the world.

If life throws you a few bad notes or vibrations, don't let them interrupt or alter your song.


If your leg is in a cast, it's really dumb to sit in front of your computer doing unnecessary stuff with it hanging down. Your leg will swell and heal slower, if at all. When you go to your doctor, he/she will give you one of those you're really dumb and self destructive looks. Also, Why didn't you follow my orders and rest? Your doctor will be right, and so will mine at my next office visit. Elevate, folk! Elevate your mind, your soul, and your leg, in the order needed!

Believe in your heart that you're meant to live a life full of passion, purpose, magic and miracles.


It has been often said that writing is 99 percent perspiration and 1 percent inspiration. In my experience, this is true. But, in my opinion, it is useless without that 1 percent. It's like an engine without fuel -- can't get anywhere without it. Or like a lighthouse without a light on top -- doesn't guide anyone in to home or safe harbor.


Discipline your mind to see the good in every situation and look on the best side of every event.


Be brave and take risks... You don't have to have it all figured out to move forward.

How much you can learn when you fail determines how far you will go into achieving your goals.


Start each day with a positive thought and a grateful heart.


Do what you love, love what you do, and with all your heart give yourself to it.


Believe in your infinite potential. Your only limitations are those you set upon yourself.


You cannot control what happens to you, but you can control the way you think about all the events. You always have a choice. You can choose to face them with a positive mental attitude.


Never allow the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game!


Don't be distracted by criticism. Remember ~ the only taste of success some people have is when they take a bite out of you.


Mindfulness helps us get better at seeing the difference between what's happening and the stories we tell ourselves about what's happening, stories that get in the way of direct experience. Often such stories treat a fleeting state of mind as if it were our entire and permanent self.


To become a master at any skill, it takes the total effort of your: heart, mind, and soul working together in tandem.


Why are there trees I never walk under but large and melodious thoughts descend upon me?

YOU are your love of a lifetime.


Why sadness was created?

In honor of Oprah Winfrey: Even greater than the ability to inspire others with hope is the power to motivate them to give as much to the lives of others as they would give to their own; and to empower them to confront the worst in themselves in order to discover and claim the best in themselves.


I make music for ears, not eyes


One doesn't have to be religious to lead a moral life or attain wisdom.


No man is ever just one thing.


You do it for yourself. You don't expect to change the world. You don't even expect to influence your family or your friends. You do it because you can't not do it and be who you are. Or who you're meant to be.


An intelligent woman is a goldmine! She has the ability to learn, reason and understand things better and faster than her contemporaries. She is competent, alert and can reason out stuffs easily.


If pain is a pot of boiling water, humor can be the rising steam.


Failure is when you give up. A real winner is someone that doesn't give up, even when it feels like they are losing.

Directing the mind to stay in the present can be a formidable task.


It does not manifest so that you can believe in it. You believe in it so that it can manifest.

‎With each experience we grow and become more aware of the inner beauty that lies within us. Ultimately we are truly our own leader. We lead the connection and flow of life that is our inheritance.


Surprise is where creativity comes in.


Each one of us holds the promise of greatness within our heart, minds, and souls. Our potential and where it leads us are as unique as our fingerprints, yet the way to access what is possible is universal. Affirm your life; find joy every day, even in the mundane; and embrace your strengths and use them better yourself and the world.

-We need more love, to supersede hatred, -We need more strength,

Please... Whoever you are, whatever you are... I believe in you even though I don't completely understand you. I feel you around me even though I can't exactly describe what I'm feeling. Sometimes things happen to me and I know that you're there and I'm humbled by the lack of coincidence that exists in the world. Whatever you want from me, it's yours  just please help me. You know how I get when I lose control, and I find myself constantly being pulled back there these days.


Fueled by my inspiration, I ran across the room to steal the cup of coffee the bookshelf had taken prisoner. Lapping the black watery brew like a hyena, I tossed the empty cup aside. I then returned to the chair to continue my divine act of creation. Hot blood swished in my head as my mighty pen stole across the page.


As Dostoevski said: 'Love in action is a harsh and dreadful thing compared with love in dreams.

I am no nihilist. I am not even a cynic. I am, actually, rather romantic. And here's my idea of romance: You will soon be dead. Life will sometimes seem long and tough and, god, it's tiring. And you will sometimes be happy and sometimes sad. And then you'll be

If you want the answerask the question.


And the second [thing about the CBS EVENING NEWS that stands out in the mind of Michael J. Fox] was something Katie did later in the interview, as the drugs kicked in and the tremors segued into the jerkiness of dyskinesias. Somewhere in the contortions of making a point, my left arm detached the microphone clip from my jacket lapel. With no fuss and hardly a break in conversation or eye contact, she calmly leaned over and refastened it. Neither of us commented on it, but it was such an empathetic gesture, so far from anything patronizing or pitying, a simple kindness that allowed me the dignity to carry on making a point more important than the superficiality of my physical circumstance...

When I observe Gram, I see how fragile the notion of tradition can be. If I take my eyes off the way she kneads her Easter bread, or if I fail to study the way she sews a seam in suede, or if I lose the mental image I have of her when she negotiates a better deal with a button salesman, somehow, the very essence of her will be lost. When she goes, the responsibility for carrying on will fall to me. My mother says I'm the keeper of the flame, because I work here, and because I choose to live here. A flame is a very fragile thing, too, and there are times when I wonder if I'm the on who can keep it going.


I never want you to deny anything about yourself because you have grown up thinking it's unacceptable or inconvenient for the people around you.


One need not believe in Pallas Athena, the virgin goddess, to be overwhelmed by the Parthenon. Similarly, a man who rejects all dogmas, all theologies and all religious formulations of beliefs may still find Genesis the sublime book par excellence. Experiences and aspirations of which intimations may be found in Plato, Nietzsche, and Spinoza have found their most evocative expression in some sacred books. Since the Renaissance, Shakespeare, Rembrandt, Mozart, and a host of others have shown that this religious dimension can be experienced and communicated apart from any religious context. But that is no reason for closing my heart to Job's cry, or to Jeremiah's, or to the Second Isaiah. I do not read them as mere literature; rather, I read Sophocles and Shakespeare with all my being, too.


Reconnect with the highest truth and ignite the divine sparks in you.


I accept the Organic Trinity of Mineral, Vegetable, and Animal with as much authority as I accept the Holy Trinity. Both are sacred.


We can not, therefore, reserve as sacred anything that is not truth and yet we cannot turn from things of truth have inspired us in our everyday lives. We must merely embrace both hard and soft truths that must not be avoided. This does not mean we can reserve for ourselves the right to be self-righteous nor call others self-righteous simply because they disagree with us.


PRAISE FOR 'THE JOURNEY HOME'

If you always do what is easy and choose the path of least resistance, you never step outside your comfort zone. Great things don't come from comfort zones.


In a world so redolent with wonder, how can we allow ourselves to conduct our daily lives with so little insight, such absence of dignity?


The urge to create a fictional narrative is a mysterious one, and when an idea comes, the writer's sense of what a story wants to be is only vaguely visible through the penumbra of inspiration.


Let it be told to the future world that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive, that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet it.


Associate yourself with people who think positively. You cannot surround yourself with negative people and expect positive outcomes.


If you have kindness in your heart, you offer acts of kindness to touch the hearts of others wherever you gowhether they are random or planned. Kindness becomes a way of life.


Integrity is doing the right thing when nobody's watching, doing as you say you would do.


In this walk to freedom, we must, without question obtain hearts of honesty and a tongue of truthfulness.


Focus on your goals, not your fear.


Great goals make great people. People cannot hit what they do not aim for.


Be grateful for what you already have while you pursue your goals.


To have what you have never had, you have to do what you have never done.


Always have a willing hand to help someone, you might be the only one that does.


We have to be honest about what we want and take risks rather than lie to ourselves and make excuses to stay in our comfort zone.


Success is not how high you have climbed, but how you make a positive difference to the world.


I've always seen this in you, ever since you were a little girl  this hunger to love other people into their highest selves and it's what has made me irreversibly and just so forever in love with you.


Everywhere we shine death and life burn into something new...


Forgiveness means letting go of the hope for a better past.


Focus on faith and grow your roots strong and deep so no one can make you believe in something that is not good for your soul.


Do you wait for things to happen, or do you make them happen yourself? I believe in writing your own story.


To realize one's destiny is a person's only real obligation and when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.


Have you realized that today is the tomorrow you talked about yesterday? It is your responsibility to change your life for the better.


Someone needs to fight, someone needs to sacrifice, someone needs to inspire, someone needs to be a hero.


An idea, like a ghost, must be spoken to a little before it will explain itself.


Cancer gave me an understanding of the point of all this. To survive. Most of our lives it is easy but for the moments when it becomes difficult, when accident or sickness or sadness strikes, it's just about remembering one thing. You must simply survive.


There is only one you for all time. Fearlessly be yourself.


Nothing makes a person desire improvement like failure


Separate yourself from those who hinder your vision. Make a choice to walk away from the trap set to ensnare you. Realize when someone is pulling you backwards every time you take a step forward. Separate from them and the result of your action will be a life of success.


Where would we have been without the discoveries of our predecessors, and where are we going without your discoveries?


Goals are dreams with a deadline.


One more thing...


Stay present for the now of your life. It's your point of power.


I do not write poetry; I take words and dip them in feelings.


A child's imaginary playmate just might actually be there.


[Robert's eulogy at his brother, Ebon C. Ingersoll's grave. Even the great orator Robert Ingersoll was choked up with tears at the memory of his beloved brother]

Life is really very simple. In each moment, we have the opportunity to choose between saying yes or no, to listen to our intuition, to listen to our true inner voice, the Existential voice within ourselves. When we say yes, we have contact with Existence and we receive nourishment, love, joy, support and inspiration. When we say no, we create a separation from life and begin to create dreams and expectations of how it should be. We begin to live in the memories of the past and in the fantasies of the future – as if any other time than here and now really could make us happy and satisfied.


Perhaps just to have loved was enough - just to have seen this world,and known it,through the eyes of love.


When inspiration is silent reason tires quickly.


Don't try to follow trends. Create them.


Mëso të mos e shkatërrosh me fjalë atë çfarë ke ndërtuar me heshtje.


Love' is the only weapon I have, I will defend with love, I will attack with love.


Everyday of your life is a another lesson. If you learn the lesson well and apply it; whether positive or negative, you determine what happens in your tomorrow.


Seek your own answers in life, and not what others dictate to you.


We will never have a perfect world, but it's not romantic or naïve to work toward a better one.


Live like there's no tomorrow and learn as if your life depends on it


Souls reconstructed with faith transform agony into peace.


Hating skin color is contempt for God's divine creative imagination. Honoring it is appreciation for conscious, beautiful-love-inspired diversity.


Man is a slow, sloppy, and brilliant thinker; computers are fast, accurate, and stupid.


You need to trust

You have to find your own shtick. A Picasso always looks like Picasso painted it. Hemingway always sounds like Hemingway. A Beethoven symphony always sounds like a Beethoven symphony. Part of being a master is learning how to sing in nobody else's voice but your own.


When we are aware of our weaknesses or negative tendencies, we open the opportunity to work on them.


There is a secret place. A radiant sanctuary. As real as your own kitchen. More real than that. Constructed of the purest elements. Overflowing with the ten thousand beautiful things. Worlds within worlds. Forests, rivers. Velvet coverlets thrown over featherbeds, fountains bubbling beneath a canopy of stars. Bountiful forests, universal libraries. A wine cellar offering an intoxi cation so sweet you will never be sober again. A clarity so complete you will never again forget. This magnificent refuge is inside you. Enter. Shatter the darkness that shrouds the doorway... Believe the incredible truth that the Beloved has chosen for his dwelling place the core of your own being because that is the single most beautiful place in all of creation.

Mindfulness, also called wise attention, helps us see what we're adding to our experiences, not only during meditation sessions but also elsewhere.


ليس الخلاص عندي في رفض الحياه ,فاني لأحس ضمه الحريه في عشرات المئات من قيود الملذات ,كلا..لن اغلق حواسي , ان مباهج النظر, والسمع واللمس ستحمل دائما طابع النعيم الاكبر , اجل ان كل اوهامي ستتقد لتكون انوارا في مهرجان الافراح وستنضج كل اشواقي لتكون ثمارا في ربيع الحب وهو موقف ايجابي من الحياه والطبيعه.


Getting carried away is stupid, it won't get me anywhere.

I learned long ago that when change comes, you gotta slow down and take note of it. In the midst of that change is all the possibility in the world.


People will find transformation and transcendence in a McDonald's hash brown if it's all they've got.


Second half of the year starts NOW July 1st with the next 6 months being MORE important than the last 6 months. I Your Name promise to do all that I can to achieve my Goal . I will not sit on a corner wait I will seek my opportunity. I promise to go after my Goal with passion knowing that the clock is ticking... Sign and date


Watch what you ask for you just might get it.


The practice of lovingkindness can uplift us & relieve sorrow & unhappiness.


It's strange, isn't it, how you never know you're living the best time of your life at the moment you're living it? If you could appreciate, at that instant, that this is it, maybe you'd make certain your mind imprinted every detail of the sights, smells, sounds and sensations.

People turn to meditation because they want to make good decisions, break bad habits & bounce back better from disappointments.


You never know what will save you.


In a time when I need a little hope I look at a photo of where I call home and think of the moment I'll have when I go back with my trials and struggles carried in a box able to be let free and turn into achievements and happiness.


Stories are the collective wisdom of everyone who has ever lived. Your job as a storyteller is not simply to entertain. Nor is it to be noticed for the way you turn a phrase. You have a very important job--one of the most important. Your job is to let people know that everyone shares their feelings--and that these feelings bind us. Your job is a healing art, and like all healers, you have a responsibility. Let people know they are not alone. You must make people understand that we are all the same.


Trying to live up to yourself is the most trying thing.


What is more yours than what always holds you back?


You're never going to walk around fear. You're only going to walk through it. I have to do all those things I am afraid of, but I do them constantly renewing my mind.


Each day is a gift

Knowledge does not come to us by details, but in flashes of light from heaven.


Moving forward implies MOTION when in all actuality it may be simply standing STILL and seeing the salvation of the Lord.


It's not about what I SEE for our future, or humanity; It's about what I DO for our future and humanity.


Creativity thrives where its roots are crowded.


Writing is the thing that props me up.


Anguish is the universal language


When you enter a grove peopled with ancient trees, higher than the ordinary, and shutting out the sky with their thickly inter-twined branches, do not the stately shadows of the wood, the stillness of the place, and the awful gloom of this doomed cavern then strike you with the presence of a deity?


Four times during the first six days they were assembled and briefed and then sent back. Once, they took off and were flying in formation when the control tower summoned them down. The more it rained, the worse they suffered. The worse they suffered, the more they prayed that it would continue raining. All through the night, men looked at the sky and were saddened by the stars. All through the day, they looked at the bomb line on the big, wobbling easel map of Italy that blew over in the wind and was dragged in under the awning of the intelligence tent every time the rain began. The bomb line was a scarlet band of narrow satin ribbon that delineated the forward most position of the Allied ground forces in every sector of the Italian mainland.

Don't be afraid to stand tall in YOUR truth! Boldly and confidently face everything that has, and is, keeping you bound. Fight for your inner peace! Fight for your happiness! Fight for everything and everybody that's important to you! You are NOT a victim! Don't even play into that. You owe it to yourself to LIVE! Live your life without the regrets, without the resentments, without the unforgiveness, without the blame game, without the self-pity, without any and everything that keeps you from experiencing true joy within! You are too important to waste your life away! Learn to appreciate and value your life, but most importantly, learn to appreciate and value yourself! You count too, no matter what you've done!


we tend to steer our lives in the direction of the lessons we need to learn


In life there is reality and there is what you want in life. If you took a moment to step back and forget about everything that is going on that doesn't really mean that much anyway, you might be able to figure out how to get what you want and what has been stopping you. For every problem there is a solution, for every... need God has provided the answer, and for every want there is a way. Reality is what you make it.


But can one actually see beauty with eyes blurred by the lack of almost everything a human being needs?


Opposition can be your friend. Opposition can be the fire that tempers the better sword, as well as the ice that cools a fiery temper. Don't ever run from it; learn from it!


It's better to dare to dream big and achieve half of your dreams than to dream small dreams and achieve all


Isn't it amazing how we always have to put our mark on things? And how, from the natural world, we find evidence over and over again that reminds us, not so much of the birds, but of our own stories and our own kinds of art?


Believe, my child. Faith is the food of survival.


Can you identify the source preventing you from feeling good every single day, from loving yourself unconditionally and making your dreams come true? Is it a voice in your head or a gut wrenching ache that compromises your inner peace and doesn't allow you to accept the love around you? Is there one thing, or maybe many things, keeping you from forgiving your past and moving forward, tormenting you with lies like You don't deserve real love so just settle for whatever you can get, You're not smart enough to achieve your dream so don't even try, or Look at your past... you should hate yourself way more than you actually do!?

There's a kid or some kids somewhere. I'll never know them. They're particle-puzzle-cubing right now. They might be mini-misanthropes from Moosefart, Montana. They might be demi-dystopians from Dogdick, Delaware. They dig my demonic dramas. The metaphysic maims them. They grasp the gravity. They'll duke it out with their demons. They'll serve a surfeit of survival skills. They won't be chronologically crucified.

Arithmetic is the death of story.


Dissatisfaction can be a source of inspiration if you learn to control it.


Don't let your emotions get in the way of rational decision making.


Even if we try to conform to ideals and strive for perfection, we will always be pulled back to our core identity because it's the path of least resistance for our souls – an energy force that wants nothing more than for us to honor and accept who we are and discover what we're meant to do in the world.


Instead of worrying about what you cannot control, focus your energy on what you can create.


Seek first the kingdom of heaven WITHIN, whereby lies an abundance of treasures and resources that you need


In the height of the gusts, in my high position, where the seas did not break, I found myself compelled to cling tightly to the rail to escape being blown away. My face was stung to severe pain by the high-driving spindrift, and I had a feeling that the wind was blowing the cobwebs out of my sleep-starved brain.


When you encourage others, you boost their self-esteem, enhance their self-confidence, make them work harder, lift their spirits and make them successful in their endeavors. Encouragement goes straight to the heart and is always available. Be an encourager. Always.


Momentum builds success.


Scientists used to do an experiment whereby a dog's repeated reward for performing a task was unaccountably replaced by punishment. The dog, knowing it would be penalized for doing well or doing badly, would become melancholic and inactive. This and other unforeseeable results were funded by taxing up to sixty percent of people's earnings. People became strangely melancholic and inactive

When you start giving, instead of getting, you make a difference... You can always give a warm smile, a sincere hello, a positive vibe... your concern, your attention, your time, your love, and kindness to those around you.


Don't let your mind talk you out of your dreams, trick you into giving up; don't let your mind become the greatest obstacle to success. To get your mind on the right track, the rest will follow.


Be grateful for what you already have while you pursue what you want.


Be brave to stand for what you believe in even if you stand alone.


Don't let procrastination take over your life. Be brave and take risks. Your life is happening right now.


Courage is feeling fear, not getting rid of fear, knowing something is more important than fear and taking action in the face of fear.


So many people will tell you no, and you need to find something you believe in so hard that you just smile and tell them watch me. Learn to take rejection as motivation to prove people wrong. Be unstoppable. Refuse to give up, no matter what. It's the best skill you can ever learn.


I feel a resurgence of my 6-year-old self... that little warrior, goddess of a girl reminding me of who I was when I was little, before the world got its hands on me.


I know that this process of 'me changing my life' doesn't just end once I set fire to this list of things I hate about myself. Tonight isn't as much of a new beginning as it is a violent end and I know the real work hasn't even started yet.


Support and encouragement are found in the most unlikely places.


I'm going to follow this invisible red thread until I find myself again... until I finally figure out... who I'm meant to be.


Nothing is born into this world without labor.


In order to grow, I promise you'll have to let go of some habits. 10 times out of 10, they'll be the habits you're most in love with.


Fairies with gossamer wings,

If not in the moment, where do you propose to live?


There can be no forced inspiration.


The most unlucky generation is the one which couldn't produce a hero to look upto.


Motivation gets you going; Inspiration keeps you going.


The excitement of dreams coming true is beyond the description of words.


God is not willing to do everything, and thus take away our free will and that share of glory which belongs to us.


Entertainment is temporary happiness, but the real happiness is permanent entertainment.


The more details, depth and thought you put into your ideas the more valuable they become.


When a man finds this kind of woman, he will go all out for her knowing that she will not be a letdown.


There are Tantrics who deliberately seek to do more active forms of renunciation, so transgression of social norms and breaking of taboo, and breaking of social taboos especially, is a form of renunciation.


Today is a gift from God. Don't waste it!


Happiness depends on your mindset and attitude. Happiness is in your mind, not in the circumstance.


Whatever choice you make makes you. Choose wisely.


Let people be the pursuits of happiness, you be the pursuit of perfection.


Cultivate plants which attract lovely company.


It's never been easier for audiences to skip, filter, or avoid advertising, so the best ideas are the ones that respect that the audience needs to get something out of the work; it should inspire, satisfy, or motivate them. You can't just bombard people with messages anymore.


You have two choices, to conquer your fear or to let your fear conquer you.


No one has ever achieved greatness without dreams.


Gratitude builds a bridge to abundance.


To conquer fear is the best way to gain your self-confidence.


Failures are the stairs we climb to reach success.


Be positive. Be true. Be kind.


It's not about perfect. It's about effort. And when you bring that effort every single day, that's where transformation happens. That's how change occurs.


Reading is like travel, allowing you to exit your own life for a bit, and to come back with a renewed, even inspired, perspective.


When love dies, the heart's ashes do not leave on the windthey rest on the mantelpiece of the soul, darkening the sunrise we once saw to be beautiful.


And now that its ruby eyes are set into the gold, you cannot see their tear-shape, so they seem to be laughing rather than crying. It is a constant reminder to me of the human ability to create something beautiful even when things are at the darkest.


Bad luck with women is a determined man's road to success. For every affliction, he makes, out of indignation, yet another advancement in order to exceed the man that the woman chose over him. This goes to show that great men are made great because they once learned how to fight the feeling of rejection.


Love, as life, is a journey. Finding true love for the ever after is an amazing achievement.


And life is a good thing for a writer. It's where we get our raw material, for a start. We quite like to stop and watch it.


You have a masterpiece inside you, you know. One unlike any that has ever been created, or ever will be. If you go to your grave without painting your masterpiece, it will not get painted. No one else can paint it. Only you.


That's why it's called a practice. We have to practice a practice if it is to be of value.


Do not empower your negative thoughts by giving them legs so they can run around your mind, creating worries,frustrations, and anxiety in your life.


The only difference between a grown-up's mistake and a child's is the size of the consequence.


What is more precious: a thousand answers derived from one question? Or, one answer...from a thousand questions?


If you have a painting in you, paint. If you have a song to sing, sing. Don't judge your creation. Just create it. Banish doubt and fear and step out of your own way if you have to. Write if you're a writer and invent if you're an inventor. Do what you were born to do. Only then will you know a remarkable life.


When you face a new challenge, remember the skills, talent, guts and resources that got you through before.


Most of us who turn to any subject with love remember some morning or evening hour when we got on a high stool to reach down an untried volume, or sat with parted lips listening to a new talker, or for very lack of books began to listen to the voices within, as the first traceable beginning of our love.


Sometimes you must stand still in order to get moving to where GOD wants you to go.


Anybody with leisure can do that who is willing to begin where everything ought to be begun--that is, at the beginning. Nothing worth calling good can or ever will be started full grown. The essential of any good is life, and the very body of created life, and essential to it, being its self operant, is growth. The larger start you make, the less room you leave for life to extend itself. You fill with the dead matter of your construction the places where assimilation ought to have its perfect work, building by a life-process, self-extending, and subserving the whole. Small beginnings with slow growings have time to root themselves thoroughly--I do not mean in place nor yet in social regard, but in wisdom. Such even prosper by failures, for their failures are not too great to be rectified without injury to the original idea.


We have a right to decide how we want our bodies to look and feel, but unfortunately we do not exercise these rights. Instead, we tend to drift along, victims of our own ignorance of the fact that we can have what we want, if we are willing to take that first step toward developing the self-discipline to govern our thoughts.


But that initial, comet-blazing-across-the-sky, Big Idea is only the beginning. Each book is composed of a mosaic of thousands of little ideas, ideas that invariably come to me at two in the morning when my alarm is set for seven.


We all have issues & we have usually come by them honestly.


What have you gained since you haven't prayed? What will you lose if you pray?


Paranormal events are just edges of the infinite we happen to encounter.


Satisfaction in life doesn't jump on you, you work for it, you earn it. You will not sit in a place, fold your hands and expect to be satisfied with life.


There's always that song that brings you back to the past. That makes you pause in the middle of what you're doing just so you could hear it clearly. The words bringing you back to a time that seemed nearly impossible, the words making you think for one moment that time itself has actually stopped. And there's nothing but you & perfect melody that brings you one step closer to what used to be.


Extend your best before date by living a youthful life.


God doesn't like it when we ask Him for the smallest things, dare to make your dream so big that He can conveniently fit into it and make your dream come true.


You know how sometimes you remember a place you once loved, a movie you've enjoyed, only to be disappointed when you return to that place or see that movie for a second time? Well, it wasn't disappointing. She sounds exactly as I remember herand there is still something so warm and caring about her that it is difficult to hate her for how she abandoned us.


We co-create our reality with others in unseen ways.


Life is real, and you canot live a lie.


In this world, people actually don't live a life for themselves but usually live a life for someone they love.


What we can change is our perceptions, which have the effect of changing everything.


What is lovely never dies, but passes into other loveliness, Star-dust, or sea-foam, flower or winged air.


The thing I want you especially to understand is this feeling of divine revelation. I feel that this structure was out there all along I just couldn't see it. And now I can! This is really what keeps me in the math game-- the chance that I might glimpse some kind of secret underlying truth, some sort of message from the gods.


There are... otherwise quite decent people who are so dull of nature that they believe that they must attribute the swift flight of fancy to some illness of the psyche, and thus it happens that this or that writer is said to create not other than while imbibing intoxicating drink or that his fantasies are the result of overexcited nerves and resulting fever. But who can fail to know that, while a state of psychical excitement caused by the one or other stimulant may indeed generate some lucky and brilliant ideas, it can never produce a well-founded, substantial work of art that requires the utmost presence of mind.


Curiosity is the single most important attribute with which humans are born. More than a simple desire to discover or know things, curiosity is a powerful tool, like a scalpel or a searchlight. Curiosity changes us. It is also a way to effect change, perhaps even on a global level.


-حياه الانسان هي مشوار طويل عبر الليل , ملي بالمتاعب والالام,تحيطه الاشباح مغير المرئيه,تجاه هدف واحيأمل القليلون في الوصول اليه ولا يتمهل أحد طويلا قبالته.واحدا تلو الاخر , وبينما هم سائرون ,يختفي رفاقنا عن انظارنا ,تقبضهم الاوامر الصامته للموت القاهر, وقصير جدا ذلك الوقت الذي نستطيع فيه مسااعدتهم , والذي تتحدد فيه سعادتهم او شقاؤهم.فليكن اذن أن ننثر الضياء في طريقهم, ونخفف أحزانهم بأكف التعاطف, ونمنحهم الغبطه الخالصه للتعاطف الذي لا يفتر ,بأن نقوي العزائم المنهاره ونوفر لهم الايمان في ساعات اليأس , ولنتوقف عن قياس مزاياهم وعيوبهم بمقاييس جامده, ولنفكر فقط في احتياجاتهم, في الاحزان والصعوبات والقهر والعمي الذي يكتنف حياتهم ويسبب لهم البؤس , ولنتذكر انهم كانوا رفاق المعاناه في نفس الظلمات, وممثلين في نفس التراجيديا معنا.


Loving oneself

Fight ever on: this earthly stuff

When you let go of past pain, believe in yourself, and follow your dreamsyou can find true happiness!


Is being burnt a requisite for the making of art? Personally, I don't think it is. But art is poultice for a burn. It is a privilege to have, somewhere within you, a capacity for making something speak from your own seared experience.


We can make room for more experiences of radiance, peace, and beauty; and when we do, they arrive. When we make an intention to experience peace, when we value it enough to make room for it and invite it into our busy lives, it arrives bearing gifts. We make room for this guest, not by

Love is the only energy I've ever used as a writer. I've never written out of anger, although anger has informed love.


The best of humanity's recorded history is a creative balance between horrors endured and victories achieved, and so it was during the Harlem Renaissance.


Good men do the most harm.


Faith is the door to the full inner life of the Church, a life which includes not only access to an authoritative teaching but above all to a deep personal experience which is at once unique and yet shared by the whole Body of Christ, in the Spirit of Christ.


In tough and desperate times when your creativity begs to be birthed, loose the confines of the ground; stand up in your faith and walk atop the waves...


Anything creative requires a bit of acting,and filling in blanks with imagination.


Think it. Write it. Sell it.


People need not fear the unknown if they have a capable of achieving what they need and what


It's how we see the world that keeps the darkness beyond at bay. Keeps it from pouring through and devouring us. I think all of us might know that, way down deep.


Meditation is essentially training our attention so that we can be more aware not only of our own inner workings but also of what's happening around us in the here & now.


Being a senior doesn't automatically make one wise but the wise & foolish alike have things to teach us.


We must experience certain things in life, even in our childhood, so we can later look back and value the journey.


Language imparts identity, meaning, and perspective to our human condition. Writers are either polluters or part of the cleanup.


The average Bhutanese knows much more about the world than the average American...(for Americans)It is more comfortable to watch fake news about celebrities than to know what's happening in China or southern Sudan. But events happening in China or Sudan affect us so much more because they are real.


Writing is the voices inside our heads, our minds, the creativity that exists for us to, from nothing, create alternate worlds, manipulate a personality or to introduce a new kind of love, a new kind of hate or pain or happiness or wonder or... anything we want. Through words, we can do, we can be anything we want.


Real freedom lies in wildness,not in civilization!!


Strong delusions travel like cold germs on a sneeze.


The number of those who have nothing to recommend them and of those in whom nothing but good can be found is probably equal


Your tears only water your weeds


Every perfect traveler always creates the country where he travels.


Strive to make small changes and learn something new daily, because there is always these experiences you have had to tap into for the future.


Imitation is not inspiration, and inspiration only can give birth to a work of art. The least of man's original emanation is better than the best of borrowed thought.


People who work in an environment where doing their best is recognized have a better chance of feeling good about their work.


An artist without ideas is a mendicant; barren, he goes begging among the hours.


A mountain is the best medicine for a troubled mind. Seldom does man ponder his own insignificance. He thinks he is master of all things. He thinks the world is his without bonds. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Only when he tramps the mountains alone, communing with nature, observing other insignificant creatures about him, to come and go as he will, does he awaken to his own short-lived presence on earth.


Talent is a faucet. When it is on, one must write. Inspiration is a farce that poets have invented to give themselves importance.


On my website there's a quote from the writer Anthony Burgess: The greatest gift is the passion for reading. It is cheap, it consoles, it distracts, it excites, it gives you knowledge of the world and experience of a wide kind.

We would never call inexplicable little insights 'hunches,' for fear of drawing the universe's attention. But they happened, and you knew you had been in the proximity of one that had come through if you saw a detective kiss his or her fingers and touch his or her chest where a pendant to Warsha, patron saint of inexplicable inspirations, would, theoretically, hang.


Everybody trusts a guy in a raincoat. I don't know why. It's just one of those mystery facts.


Do an evening review at the end of the day to reflect on what went well, and what you'd do differently next time.


A traitor commits his crime but once. The rest/is retribution.


Memoria selectiva para recordar lo bueno, prudencia logica para no arruinar el presente y optimismo desafiante para encarar al futuro.


How many fears came between us?

Dituntun oleh masa laluku, didorong oleh keberadaanku, aku terbang mencari sesuatu yang tak kuketahui. Antusiasme, rasa ingin tahu, dan harapan menemaniku.


Silence is so steadfast, you know. It is so ample, after all.


Circumstances are the seeds of literature.


When his writing is going well, Gordon Strangle Mars likes to wake up at 6 a.m. and go out driving. He works out new plot lines about giant spiders and keeps an eye out for abandoned couches, which he wrestles into the back of his pickup truck. Then he writes for the rest of the day.


One can't work/by limelight.//A bowlful/right at/one's elbow//produces no/more than/a baleful/glow against/the kitchen table.//The fruit purveyor's/whole unstable/pyramid//doesn't equal/what daylight did.


It is a cliche that human beings are fascinated by size--mountain peaks, high buildings, and whales. We are also amazed by miniatures--a flea on a mouse, a flea on a trapeze, the Last Supper carved on the head of a pin.


The Spirit of God breathes inspiration, while the carnal mind breeds vanity.


People are not being reached in the context of the body of Christ--they're like newborn babies being left on a doorstep somewhere to feed and care for themselves.


The stationary condition is the beginning of the end


take words and make them useful,' she told me. 'drain them of all the crappy meanings they used to mean and make them mean something useful instead.


It's not something he can do anything about, being a bleeder, anymore than a guy with a glass jaw can do something about not having whiskers.


You might be looking forward to working, falling in love, marrying, raising a family. You are told that you should expect to find a job paying so much, where your hours are so much, where your responsibilities are so much.

Jeremy and Karl and Elizabeth have known each other since the first day of kindergarten. Amy and Talis are a year younger...Now the five are inseparable; invincible. They imagine that life will always be like this--like a television show in eternal syndication--that they will always have each other. They use the same vocabulary. They borrow each other's books and music. They share lunches, and they never say anything when Jeremy comes over and takes a shower. They all know Jeremy's father is eccentric. He's supposed to be eccentric. He's a novelist.


There is no time to waste in life and there is no cut and paste as well, only copy and paste – you can only emulate others


I think of inspiration as desire infused with spirit and topped with an almost reckless optimism.


Think the tree that bears nutrition:

I once had a love

Wandering is the activity of the child, the passion of the genius; it is the discovery of the self, the discovery of the outside world, and the learning of how the self is both at one with and separate from the outside world. These discoveries are as fundamental to the soul as learning to survive is fundamental to the body. These discoveries are essential to realizing what it means to be human. To wander is to be alive.


You can grow like a tall tree, when you enjoy the sun, wind, rain, storms and the stars in the dark nights.


Those who don't value their words, will never value your wishes.


I just want your voice aimed at me again. I want to absorb the direction of your eyes...


The best traveler is one without a camera.


Pursue your dreams. You will be amazed about what you can achieve.


Do not let arrogance go to your head and despair to your heart.


The possibility of the dream gives strength.


To fall in love for any reason does cause fires of emotion. When we are in love, we ride on a positive energy as compared to not being in love. When we are love, we transcend conditional love to that of unconditional and we are now flowering in consciousness. Love is a very important element of consciousness as it becomes purer with Source union even as our consciousness is expanded further. Consciousness is love that is light.


A poet, you see, is a light thing, and winged and holy, and cannot compose before he gets inspiration and loses control of his senses and his reason has deserted him.


Change your attitude and you change your life.

Dream your own dreams, achieve your own goals. Your journey is your own and unique.


Daily dance uplift the soul to spiritual realms.


Do not let the roles you play in life make you forget that you are human.


Never underestimate yourself when you do what is right.

Love is total surrender, total acceptance and total commitment.


Each day brings new opportunities, allowing you to constantly live with lovebe there for othersbring a little light into someone's day. Be grateful and live each day to the fullest.


Everyone's time is limited. What matters most is to focus on what matters most.


Whatever you dream of, there will be fulfillment.


Unity is the intentional inclination to corporately control our destination. In other words, achieving the dream takes a team!


When you open your mind, you open new doors to new possibilities for yourself and new opportunities to help others.


If careful attention is paid to the reality, we will see clearly, the real shortage is of the right skills, rather than of jobs. If the right skills are developed, the right start-ups and other enterprises will emerge and provide the jobs needed. It's always the horse before the cart, not the other way round. At a personal level, it will require the realisation of the need for the acquisition of required skills, the discipline to pursue it and the commitment to push through. These will require a great deal of personal courage and effort. But then, the benefit will be immeasurable.


We must always remember that it is the things of the spirit that in the end prevail. That caring counts. That where there is no vision, people perish. That hope and faith count, and that without charity there can be nothing good. That by daring to live dangerously, we are learning to live generously. And that by believing in the inherent goodness of man, we may ... 'stride forward into the unknown with growing confidence.


I like the disaster of the night sky, stars spilling this way and that as if they were upturned from a glass. I like the way good madness feels. I like the way laughter always spills. That's the word for it. It never just comes, it spills. I like the word 'again'. Again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again. I like the quiet sound a coffee cup makes when it's set down on a wooden table. So hushed. So inviting. Like morning light yawning through the window and stretching out onto the kitchen floor. I like the way girls' lips look like they're stained with berries. I like the way morning light breaks like a prism through the empty wine bottles on our dusty apartment floor. Glasses empty except for the midnight hour. I like the way blueberries stain my fingers during the summer. I like the way light hits your eyes and turns it into a color that doesn't exist anywhere else other than in this moment. I want it all. I want the breeze to call my name as it rushes down my street, looking for me. I want to feel grass underneath my bare feet and I want to feel the sun kiss freckles onto my cheeks. I want to hear you yell hello as you make your way towards me, not goodbye as you have to go.

He talked about the future with such certainty, he might have been talking about the past.


To 'let go' sometimes makes us feel like losers because it means giving up what truly we felt we had a right to. But true strength lies in resisting the urge to hold onto things and people that bring us down.


Dream big. Wake up. Take the first step into the unknown.


People are successful because they think and act like successful people.


Smile more. Smiling can make you and others happy.


If ever I was running, it was towards you.


I love him in ways that I can't explain to other people. They don't understand... it's not their fault.


A birth-date is a reminder to celebrate the life as well as to update the life.


I really believe that there is an invisible red thread tied between him and me, and that it has stretched and tangled for years  across oceans and lifetimes. I know that it won't break because our souls are tied.


I could watch him do this until morning  never asking questions and never interrupting his work. I worship quietly  his intense focus and attention to detail and then, out of no where, I realize the inconvenient, inappropriate truth: 'I love this man... and it has swallowed me.


Take faith, for example. For many people in our world, the opposite of faith is doubt. The goal, then, within this understanding, is to eliminate doubt. But faith and doubt aren't opposites. Doubt is often a sign that your faith has a pulse, that it's alive and well and exploring and searching. Faith and doubt aren't opposites, they are, it turns out, excellent dance partners.


Everything hurts right now and nothing is helping because as the pain is getting worse  so is the love.


Stop worrying about someone taking your spot. God already have it reserved. Do the work to get there and fill it!


The little boy nodded at the peony and the peony seemed to nod back. The little boy was neat, clean and pretty. The peony was unchaste, dishevelled as peonies must be, and at the height of its beauty.(...) Every hour is filled with such moments, big with significance for someone.


He who does not see the light in others does not see the light in himself.


Ability, experience and books have solution for all the problems.


I want you to trust yourself, baby. Love is all that matters and you've always known that. You've known, since you were a very little girl, what your life is meant to be about...


Suffering is the noblest art, the quieter the better.


God existed before every religion; He exists in spite of all religions.


If you like fantasy and you want to be the next Tolkien, don't read big Tolkienesque fantasies  Tolkien didn't read big Tolkienesque fantasies, he read books on Finnish philology. Go and read outside of your comfort zone, go and learn stuff.


The ultimate source of comfort and peace is within ourselves.


There is hero in everyone.

Don't ask for directions if you're not going to start the car.


Compromise brings harmony to both, happiness to none.


But while the urban tribe helps us survive, it does not help us thrive. The urban tribe may bring us soup when we are sick, but it is the people we hardly know - those who never make it into our tribe - who will swiftly and dramatically change our lives for the better.


If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor.


To soar, we must leave anything that weighs us down...


Writers are creatures of habit, as are humans, but writers aren't necessarily human, are they?


If a picture paints a thousand words, then a let a picture inspire a thousand words.


The fact is not kill entire populations is able to infect entire regions of land and control the only cure.


Hope gives us a reason to live and to make plans for our future. But common sense gives us knowledge that God has control over our life. Life is a journey. We hope and plan our future as we travel each day.


Take the breath of the new dawn and make it part of you. It will give you strength.


Your inspiration taps hidden reserves of promise that sustain people through times that induce despair. You enable people to envision a future that sustains the best from their past while also holding out new possibilities.


Anything is Possible!


Between natural ability and education choose natural ability, as it will keep you happy and will fetch you the glory sooner.


Quitting is not giving up, it's choosing to focus your attention on something more important. Quitting is not losing confidence, it's realizing that there are more valuable ways you can spend your time. Quitting is not making excuses, it's learning to be more productive, efficient and effective instead. Quitting is letting go of things (or people) that are sucking the life out of you so you can do more things that will bring you strength.


I am the happiest man alive. I have that in me that can convert poverty to riches, adversity to prosperity, and I am more invulnerable than Archilles; Fortune hath not one place to hit me.


Be a King. Dare to be Different, dare to manifest your greatness.


Don't die without fulfilling your purpose.


It's amazing how close I have been, all this time, to my old life. And yet the distance that divides me from it is vast.


God is never tired of bringing the sun out every morning, taking it in the evenings and bringing out the moon.


Dare to be different. Represent your maker well and you will forever abide in the beautiful embrace of his loving arms.


Your words are powerful so what you say goes a long way to either establish or destroy you; this is why you should say things that God has said concerning you, not things that situations or circumstances say.


Imagination is the true magic carpet.


It doesn't matter where you've been, only where you are going.


The power of hope! Even a lack of ambition can, for a time, pay off as a necessary facet, as long as hope outweighs it.


Whatever it is you are really desiring, give it away. If it's companionship, give it to someone else, and just listen to them and be there. If it's money, give it to someone who is less fortunate. If it's encouragement, give it to others. If it's friendship, become the best friend you can be to others. If it's time, serve others with your time. You will be amazed to see how much more of everything you have when you are willing to freely give.


Every negative...

The challenge is to resist circumstances. Any idiot can be happy in a happy place, but moral courage is required to be happy in a hellhole.


Each day begins a new journey of life, for if we awake, there is a reason.


Trust your inner voice.


Phantasie ist wichtiger als Wissen, denn Wissen ist begrenzt.


Who are you? No really. Way, way down deep. Who are you?


We may be living past and future lives at the same time we are living this one.


Every negative...

Believe that life is taking you down a wonderful path!


Do not look down with disdain on what Christ spent so much to achieve for you.


Other people are only aspects of our own greater being.


But if as you read this book you're saying to yourself: I'd rather be miserably married than be alone. Well young lady, take out your clown shoes and buckle your seat belt - it's going to be a very bumpy one-woman circus.


Some ghosts or felt presences may simply be the essence of another living person projected outward while sleeping.


The higher knowledge, the higher responsibility


Još uvijek silno vjerujem u umjetnost kao medikament!


Heads will fly all over the place, others will explode by themselves, everyone will have their chance to betray, and those who don't betray will be betrayed.


With a lump forming in his throat, he thought

Un archeologo è il miglior marito che una donna possa avere: più lei diventa vecchia, più lui s'interessa a lei.


The poet dreams of the mountain

This is the new year the new you. You can pass through another year, coasting on cruise control. Or you can step out of your comfort zone, trying things you have never done before, & make 2012 as the year that you elevate from where you are & soar high. Make it happen!


How will you go about finding that thing the nature of which is totally unknown to you? (Plato)

Someone is always going to try to knock you down and take your place. It is up to you to fight for what you want.


There is a power that can be created out of pent-up indignation, courage, and the inspiration of a common cause, and that if enough people put their minds and bodies into that cause, they can win. It is a phenomenon recorded again and against in the history of popular movements against injustice all over the world.


I take thee at thy word:

Time was a film run backward. Suns fled and ten million moons fled after them.


The bird of paradise alights only upon the hand that does not grasp.


Don't hide what you have just because people tell you it's not normal. I have known normal people...and guess what? They are as boring as hell...


Crises marked by anxiety, doubt, and despair have always been those periods of personal unrest that occur at the times when a man is sufficiently unsettled to have an opportunity for personal growth. We must always see our own feelings of uneasiness as being our chance for making the growth choice rather than the fear choice.


Did you have a rough month? I did :( but, you know what? There's no time to dwell on a missed opportunity or worry about what I should've done or said, beating myself up & making myself miserable about my mistakes. That doesn't work. So will take notes from that, put it behind me, move on & finish the year STRONG


Life is a constellation, the individual moments in our lives seem so pointless sometimes; but when you look at the whole picture, you can see that those little moments formed memories.


Emotions are like muscles. Most of them go highly unattended, it's usually the weaker, undefined ones that cause injury to the rest, and there is most certainly memory response in play.


The difference between vampires and angels? Angels are real.


Fear is the Fatal killer of Desire.


The philosophies of men surround us. The face of sin today often wears the mask of tolerance. Do not be deceived; behind that facade is heartache, unhappiness, and pain. You know what is right and what is wrong, and no disguise, however appealing, can change that. Be the one to make a stand for right, even if you stand alone. Have the moral courage to be a light for others to follow.


Writing a story, regardless of length, begins always with a single word.


No one should ever despair because the entrance to his or her chosen career path is clogged. There is an ancient saying: The persistent drip wears through stone.


The heart of a person only beats when it's surrounded by blood, by family.


We are spiritual children of God the Father. We preach it. We sing it. But do we really understand it? Sometimes it's easy to tell others they are loved, but not so easy to believe it of ourselves  not because we don't think God loves His children, but because we may feel undeserving of His love. The adversary loves to remind us who we are not. Not pretty. Not smart. Not strong. But God would not have sacrificed His Son to save us if we aren't worth saving.


Lately the muse has been treating me like Ike treated Tina.


Amida's unimpeded light is the sun of wisdom that destroys the mind of darkness.

Kekaguman lebih baik hanya tetap sebagai kekaguman. Kalau terlalu dekat.. Bisa seperti ikarus yang jatuh ke bumi karena sayapnya terbakar matahari..


Every human being has divinity encased within its spirit and it is the task of its creator as well as itself to set it free. No human being is an end product, every being still breathing is a creation still under creation.


There will come a time in every girl's life when she realizes that your ex-girlfriend wasn't crazy. Actually, she was right (about you).


Never let negativity derail your journey as a writer. Use the energy for your own betterment.


I let all that anger and worry go because they don't belong to me any more than the future does. And I don't wanna feel them anyhow, because the truth is, whatever happens when this war ends, here and now, far from Richmond County, I'm freer than I've ever been.


People say, 'It's hard to forgive...et al'. I think it's much harder to live peacefully. So, forgive and focus on living peacefully.


It's hard to tell where reality ends and illusions begins. They blend - then they separate


Sang waktu tidak akn pernah berbaik hati pada kelalaian


The effects you will have on your students are infinite and currently unknown; you will possibly shape the way they proceed in their careers, the way they will vote, the way they will behave as partners and spouses, the way they will raise their kids.


First of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself - nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.


Because the development of inner calm & energy happens completely within & isn't dependent on another person or a particular situation, we begin to feel a resourcefulness and independence that is quite beautifuland a huge relief.


Most ideas are born and lost in isolation.


On the second floor was the office in which Houston pounded an ancient typewriter with two fingers, always setting an example of unceasing hard work for his admiring students. They had no hint of the fact that their hard-driving dean had contracted tuberculosis while serving as a GI in France in Word War I. Houstan always seemed vibrant and impassioned in the chase for justice as he tried to expose his students to everything relating to the law that might give them an advantage.

It may be escapist, but if I have a choice between watching the news or reading a book which gets me to see the world through different eyes, I will always choose the latter!


Lee's hand shook as he filled the delicate cups. He drank his down in one gulp. Don't you see? he cried. The American Standard translation orders men to triumph over sin, and you can call sin ignorance. The King James translation makes a promise in 'Thou shalt,' meaning that men will surely triumph over sin. But the Hebrew word, the word timshel'Thou mayest' that gives a choice. It might be the most important word in the world. That says the way is open. That throws it right back on a man. For if 'Thou mayest'it is also true that 'Thou mayest not.' Don't you see?


Of course, there will always be those who look only at technique, who ask 'how', while others of a more curious nature will ask 'why'. Personally, I have always preferred inspiration to information.


Whatever harm I would do to another, I shall do first to myself.

The problem is not that you have problems; the problem is that you see having problems as a problem.


We train the mind so that we can enjoy greater peace, happiness, wisdom & equanimity.


To be saved is here, local and mortal


When gangs took over the [abandoned public land in Philadelphia] and the neighborhood took a turn for the worse, horses became a way of saving lives. By getting boys interested in raising a horse rather than killing another human being, these cowboys gave the youth something positive: father figures, focus, and the ability to stand tall.


The road to wealth is sown with false starts and failures that should in no way discourage the poor who make good or our neighbors with new found riches. We have to give it our all.


No thought is a stupid thought, those who are thoughtless are thought of as stupid.


I'm not particularly in favor of doctrine or creed, ordination, the elevation of holy texts, the institution of church, or, for that matter, Christianity. Like most religions, it has irreconcilable shortcomings and an unforgivable history. What I do favor is the attempt to make sense of things by living within a story. The Christian story, for good or ill, is my inheritance.


The whole concatenation of wild and artificial things, the natural ecosystem as modified by people over the centuries, the build environment layered over layers, the eerie mix of sounds and smells and glimpses neither natural nor crafted- all of it is free for the taking, for the taking in. Take it, take it in, take in more every weekend, every day, and quickly it becomes the theater that intrigues, relaxes, fascinates, seduces, and above all expands any mind focused on it. Outside lies utterly ordinary space open to any casual explorer willing to find the extraordinary. Outside lies unprogrammed awareness that at times becomes directed serendipity. Outside lies magic.


Let us be sure that the lady of our choice possesses certain tangible qualities that we admire; and if in other ways she falls short of our ideal, we must be patient and call to mind those qualities that first induced us to begin our courting.


If you're honest with yourself as a writer, trying to tell the best story you can, your story will be an honest one. And your values will come out, no matter how hard you try to disguise them.


The erruption of feelings & emotions that follows a near-death exerience, or any event that causes us to stop & look deeply at the reality of our lives, is ripe with the potential for insight & clarity.


The Imagination merely enables us to wander into the darkness of the unknown where, by the dim light of the knowledge we carry, we may glimpse something that seems of interest. But when we bring it out and examine it more closely it usually proves to be only trash whose glitter had caught our attention. Imagination is at once the source of all hope and inspiration but also of frustration. To forget this is to court despair.


Never let what you cannot do, stop you from doing what you can do!


Inspiration comes unawares, from unaccountable sources that have nothing to do with planning or intelligence. Let it cool ever so slightly, and you are left, pen or brush in hand, with no inspiration at all. Gifted people need not, therefore, make a song and dance about being or supposing themselves superior. They simply happened to be born with that fortunate, subconscious equipment of theirs, and the mystery exists independently of intelligence or ambition.


A teacher will be frustrated if she is only motivated to teach what she has learned. Yet, if she is motivated because of the students, then she will learn from them how to teach.


You are not here merely to making a living. You are here in order to enable the world to live more amply, with greater vision, with a finer spirit of hope and achievement.


His heart was as great as the world, but there was no room in it to hold the memory of a wrong


Humility is not weakness but a price for greatness. Be humble for CHRIST sake and watch GOD take you to places you never dreamt.


Sometimes a short cut is just a short cut to disaster.

Turn obstacles into opportunities and problems into possibilities.


I have liv'd long enough for others, like the Dog in the Wheel, and it is now the Season to begin for myself: I cannot change that Thing call'd Time, but I can alter its Posture and, as Boys do turn a looking-glass against the Sunne, so I will dazzle you all.


Spiritual literature can be a great aid to an aspirant, or it can be a terrible hindrance. If it is used to inspire practice, motivate compassion, ad nourish devotion, it serves a very valuable purpose. If scriptural study is used for mere intellectual understanding, for pride of accomplishment, or as a substitute for actual practice, then one is taking in too much mental food, which is sure to result in intellectual indigestion.


Palestine is the anvil of our souls.



Comfort zone: simply means the routine of one's daily life – it is a psychological state in which one feels familiar, safe, at ease, and secure.


At last everything was satisfactorily arranged, and I could not help admiring the setting: these mingled touches betrayed on a small scale the inspiration of a poet, the research of a scientist, the good taste of an artist, the gourmet's fondness for good food, and the love of flowers, which concealed in their delicate shadows a hint of the love of women


Nothing will unfold for us unless we move toward what

We as authors sign a pact with our readers; they'll go on reading because they trust us to play fair with them and deliver what we've promised.


Be thankful for the efforts of people who worked hard to get you where you are; you should not take it for granted and treat them with indifference.


About writing:The trick is to make sure you love what you've produced--to Believe..in order to convince.


Each of us suffers with envy/for the forgiven.


Patience, more than the ability to bear pains or endure waiting, is to be calm no matter what happens – constantly take action to turn it to positive growth opportunities – and have faith to believe that it will all work out in the end while you are waiting.


Tidak ada seorang pun yang bisa dikalahkan, sampai dia menyerah--DI DALAM PIKIRANNYA SENDIRI!


Those who win never give up.

But Alonso kept smiling that smile and nothing made any sense with that smile looking you in the face. 'Jim, don't tell me that, you know, brother-shit. I have been through it all. Take, you know, advice. There is only one thing and that is the kick, the Now. Nothing else counts. Get yours. Get it because, you know, no one cares and they will always put you down in the end, Jim, and the only word that counts is, you know, Now. Not that foolish brother and bopping jazz, Jim. Now. Because if it all don't go up in any, you know, twenty minutes; up, all gone; then they are going to put you down and keep you down. Now.


Wizards are always hungry.


Everyone knows that wizards are pigheaded and come to bad ends.

The essence of life does not consist in the lushness of your possessions, but in the richness of your heart.


Grateful people are happy people. The more things you are grateful for, the happier you will be.


Be the positive impact on someone's life.


I'm a Midwesterner, and everyone in Ohio is excited. I'm also a New Yorker, and a New Jerseyan, and an American, plus I'm an African-American, and a woman. I know it seems like I'm spreading like algae when I put it this way, but I'd like to think of the prize being distributed to these regions and nations and races.


Makin banyak kebetulan/kemiripan ditemui, makin besar kemungkinan adanya hubungan-sebab-akibat. Dan, ketika kemiripan-kemiripan ini makin bertumpuk, maka penyelidik yang cerdas dituntut untuk berhenti (lalu merenung) dan mulai memeriksa hubungan di antara mereka.


Each store will fulfil some of your needs, but no individual store can meet all of your needs. Learning how to set realistic expectations now and in future relationships requires you to examine each of the existing stores to see what they can offer.


Those who win never quit; those who quit never win.


You can have everything you want if you can put your heart and soul into everything you do.


Do not be complacent about your achievements and not to strive for continual improvement when you get to the top. As soon as you let success go to your head, you sink into following familiar patterns and play it safe. In other words, you risk losing your edge.


The mist just keeps on lifting and soon I'll be able to see all the way, as far as the earth's curvature allows. It's a blessing, that curvature, that hidden hemisphere-if we could take it all in at one, why move?


she slammed the door and

I know that your soul is on life support and that you feel lost and like you're completely spinning out of control, but you're finding yourself  here, tonight... even in this darkness.


Before this generation lose the wisdom, one advice - read books.


Let this time in your life cut you open and drain all of the things that are holding you back. I'm going to help you forgive the things that you won't let yourself forget.


Your personal truth is your gift to the world.


Your comfort zone is a place where you keep yourself in a self-illusion and nothing can grow there but your potentiality can grow only when you can think and grow out of that zone.


Let your story grow. Let it surprise you, and it will certainly surprise your readers.


Be thankful for a breath of fresh air to be alive and well. Allow love and happiness to penetrate throughout your mind and soul. Take time to relax and live in the moment, the now, the present. Enjoy today.


You never know who you're inspiring or uninspiring. People notice more than you think.


Love is my drug of choice, even if it comes laced with pain and disaster.


People who believe they have bad luck create bad luck. Those who believe they are very fortunate, that the world is a generous place filled with trustworthy people, live in exactly that kind of world.


I understood the life around me better, not from love, which everybody acknowledges to be a great teacher, but from estrangement, to which nobody has attributed the power of reinforcing insight


She's Devine.

In meetings philosophy might work,

Always be open to inspiration. You never know where it may come from. Begin with an open mind, end with an inspired heart.


If you stand right at the edge of the night sky, some place where one o'clock leaves to meet two, the breeze will carry your words up to the stars. And they'll swallow your secrets until its time to hand them over to the truths in the sky- the ones that draw maps in the black.

Pain is such a useful thing. It corrects us when we're wrong. It shapes our character. It teaches us that we're alive.


Despite what you think you know, sometimes your plans may be interrupted. Because you were designed for a purpose. You are on a mission to achieve greatness. No matter what obstacles lie in your path, you will reach your destination. Remember God's grace is sufficient.


No matter how smart we may think we are, no matter how committed we are to our truth, we can lose our way.


And me, standing under the splintered night,

Being in a relationship with some people is like pushing a boat through sand. I used to have the time and energy for that kind of nonsense, but not anymore. Relationships should be a wonderful journey of exploration and love; not grinding resistance.


Learning to focus on the big picture will help you keep things in a proper perspective.


Realize your youth while you have it. Don't squander the gold of your days, listening to the tedious, trying to improve the hopeless failure, or giving away your life to the ignorant, the common, and the vulgar. These are the sickly aims, the false ideals, of our age. Live! Live the wonderful life that is in you! Let nothing be lost upon you. Be always searching for new sensations. Be afraid of nothing


There's a difference between being alive and living.


First knowledge is the knowledge of God.


The thoughtfulness and goodwill messages from loved ones brighten my Christmas day.


You know what I love? The spaces between I love you. The tap of your fork against the plate and how my cup of wine clicks against our table. The scratchy voice coming from the radio in the other room. The quiet sound of your hand reaching across the table and whispering over mine. How your voice sounds like your mouth on the back of my neck. The soft murmur of our easy conversation.

Inspiration moves one from Pessimism to Optimism, from Doubt to Faith, from Despair to Hope, and from Darkness to Light!- RVM


I've got some questions,

Never stop dreaming, never stop believing, never give up, never stop trying, and never stop learning.


You have to appreciate where you have come from to know who you are in the present and whom you would like to be in the future.


Individually, every grain of sand brushing against my hands represents a story, an experience, and a block for me to build upon for the next generation.


War crimes, you say?

Goal Of LIFE Is patience,

If you can change the way you think in time you will notice a change in your heart and also a change in your life and the way you see things.

We sometimes have a flash of understanding that amounts to the insight of genius, and yet it slowly withers, even in our hands - like a flower. The form remains, but the colours and the fragrance are gone.


Speed is not always a constituent to great work, the process of creation should be given time and thought.

Grub Street turns out good things almost as often as Parnassus. For if a writer is hard up enough, if he's far down enough (down where I have been and am rising from, I am really saying), he can't afford self-doubt and he can't let other people's opinions, even a father's, keep him from writing.

La luz del pasillo iluminaba débilmente mi rostro que se reflejaba de modo fantasmal en el cristal de la ventanilla y me hacía recordar el que tuve en la infancia, el que naufragó para siempre en la despedida, como si aquel niño se hallara agazapado en algún lugar de mi interior esperando un descuido mío para emerger de nuevo en las aguas fangosas del pasado con su sonrisa feliz y sus ojos brillantes.

It is better to have God over your shoulder, than carry the world alone on your back.


There is no such thing as a perfect person in this world. We all must become the main characters or the stars of our lives. We are all different and start differently. But from whatever is our circumstances, it is very important that we find the opportunities to try out what we want to do.


Losing a belief in free will has not made me fatalisticin fact, it has increased my feelings of freedom. My hopes, fears, and neuroses seem less personal and indelible. There is no telling how much I might change in the future. Just as one wouldn't draw a lasting conclusion about oneself on the basis of a brief experience of indigestion, one needn't do so on the basis of how one has thought or behaved for vast stretches of time in the past. A creative change of inputs to the systemlearning new skills, forming new relationships, adopting new habits of attentionmay radically transform one's life.


Don't call yourself discouraged anymore;it's no longer your name.


She preferred the quiet solitary atmosphere, to create in her own world of paint and colour, the thrill of anticipating how her works would turn out as she eyed the blank sheets of paper or canvas before starting her next masterpiece. How satisfying it was to mess around in paint gear, without having to worry about spills, starch or frills, that was the life!


Weigh whatever you are about to say; what will it do to your hearer - encouragement, edification, disappointment or fear? What will it do to your life - glorify, edify, beautify or weigh you down? Speak well and things will go well.


Don't let any situation intimidate you anymore, don't accept defeat anymore.


In the past, I used to think that it is fundamental and natural to have everything. But I realized that is not true. Instead I realized that those are things to be grateful for. After that realization, I became comfortable. Even if I don't have it I am grateful. Such a realization also made me understand that is a way to love myself.

It isn't the subjects we write about but the seriousness and subtlety of our expression that determines the worth of or effort.


What would you say to yourself if you could actually meet a younger you?


The harder you work, the luckier you are, and I worked like hell.


You deserve to have a prosperous and abundant life!

Coincidences link us to the unknown and weave us into it.


Never outgrow your imagination.


You are not permitted to live and die as a non-entity because you have encountered the greatness that is associated with Christ.


Que les poètes morts laissent la place aux autres. Et nous pourrions tout de même voir que c'est notre vénération devant ce qui a été déjà fait, si beau et si valable que ce soit, qui nous pétrifie, qui nous stabilise et nous empêche de prendre contact avec la force qui est dessous, que l'on appelle l'énergie pensante, la force vitale, le déterminisme des échanges, les menstrues de la lune ou tout ce qu'on voudra.


I rather now strive to reach rather than wait to receive!


Let your words glorify God and edify your hearers and then beautify your life.


You have abundance all around you.


For though, I walk through the valley of shadows of Death, I will never fear. For You are in Me and I know You will never let me Go.


Words are directed to your personalities namely; - God, your hearers, devil and yourself.

Just about a month from now I'm set adrift, with a diploma for a sail and lots of nerve for oars.


Don't say negative things about your spouse and children.


When we are connected to the source, we will not be afraid of any task set before us.


You recreate your world to your taste with God's Word in your mouth.


You may not attain the highest height with one leap but my dear; you will reach your destination.


Your decision not to join the crowd may be what God is waiting for to grant you revelation on how to deliver your family, your country, business, profession or even your church!


God rewards every act of obedience to His Will.


Worship is the marriage of two Spirits - the Spirit of God and the Spirit of man.


Your mouth is not given to you for feeding alone; it is given to you to programme events and circumstance around you.


Create your world with God's Word in your mouth just say it and it will be accomplished!


So cheer up Beloved; for your God is able, He is the maker of all things.


The presence of God is so important in the life of believers. There is abundance of all you need to make your life comfortable in His presence.


You are to make your own way prosperous...Even God cannot do it for you; you will have to do it yourself by doing the right things; taking right decisions, talking right, thinking right, being at the right place with the right-kind of people and by reading the right materials.


He is the only option for better living.


The presence of the Lord destroys a life of struggle. You will struggle until you encounter His presence.


God wants all man's attention, thoughts and focus to be on Him.



It is never late, you can start the movement now, the provisions have been made, the price has been paid and the gifts have been packaged. Are you willing to change?


The choice is yours. Don't let your pronouncements destroy your destiny rather let them build your future up!


Your behavior is the sum total of your action and reaction to issues and people around you.


We cannot prevail by our own might or strength, we need to plug on to the source of our strength so that we will remain resourceful always.


Man is like a bride unto God. God is jealous when man veers away from Him.


Another way of remaining in intimacy with God is by remaining in His presence.


God comes down in the evenings to chat with man, enjoy man's company and find out how man faired in the course of the day.


God is not a thief. That which steals, kills and destroys is the devil - not God!


Do you want to make a change?...Do you want this change? Then let's move at God`s pace.


Are you the fruit of redemption? If yes, then make a delightful noise unto Him.


The Prince came to give life unto those whose lives were almost being snuffed out by the devil via the cares of this world.


You don't need to go running from pillar to post looking for what God looks like.


You are addressed by the way you dress. Your attire reflects your sense of value or taste and of course, your speech either makes or mars you.


What is it you do, then? I'll tell you: You leave out whatever doesn't suit you. As the author himself has done before you. Just as you leave things out of your dreams and fantasies. By leaving things out, we bring beauty and excitement into the world. We evidently handle our reality by effecting some sort of compromise with it, an in-between state where the emotions prevent each other from reaching their fullest intensity, graying the colors somewhat. Children who haven't yet reached that point of control are both happier and unhappier than adults who have. And yes, stupid people also leave things out, which is why ignorance is bliss. So I propose, to begin with, that we try to love each other as if we were characters in a novel who have met in the pages of a book. Let's in any case leave off all the fatty tissue that plumps up reality.


Cease trying to work everything out with your mind. It will get you nowhere. Live by intuition and inspiration and let your whole life be a Revelation.


We dropped our troubles into the lap of the storyteller, and they turned into someone else's.


It makes no sense to compare yourself with others because there will always be better & worse people than you out there. Each person has his own path to make. You are where you are now. Could you reach for the stars & have everything you want? realistically no. You may not win Olympic Gold in London 2012 , or be the CEO of a Fortune 500 company etc but you most definitely have the capacity to make YOUR life as the Masterpiece it could really be. The choice is yours...




We are not strangers in this journey of life...We are connected to each other through this mysterious field of love.


He had been dazzled. Because of the dazzling brightness, he had had to kill [Seigen]. All who had encountered Seigen had had their hearts stolen by that brightness. That envy had turned to malice.


Real love is a humble receptivity of a silent heart that is prepared to melt and merge...


Take your time.

I think about the Old Ones, that they have a past but no history. I think about the inevitability of death, and whether it's not that very inevitability that inspires us to take photographs and make scrapbooks and tell stories. That that's how we humans find our way to immortality. This is not a new thought; I've had such thoughts before. But I have a new thought now.


When you begin to reason with the Lord, your attitude to the issues of life will change.

Our tragedy is their beauty. Our pain is their art. The beatific bereavement that is our life captured on a canvas for all the world to see.


and what happens around us ,simply happens because we haven't learned to love .

Our father came to sleep in our house that night. He carried a small suitcase with a black mourning suit and a pair of polished shoes. Corrigan stopped him as he made his way up the stairs. 'Where d'you think you're going?'Our father gripped the bannister. His hands were liverspotted and I could see him trembling in his pause. 'That's not your room,' sad Corrigan. Our father tottered on the stairs. He took another step up. 'Don't,' said my brother. His voice was clear, full, confidant. Our father stood stunned. He climbed one more step and then turned, descended, looked around, lost.

Creative thinking encompassed by the Word of God infuses into you the divine ability to turn the seemingly ugly situation around.


Listen with your heart, listen to your inner voice of wisdom, listen to your dreams. You know what is right for you.


The horizon was indistinguishable from the inky black, which fell upon the desert like a sorcerer's mantle shot through with diamonds. The stars were so tiny, so far away, and yet, at the moment, with her fingers curled around his, he almost felt as though he could reach up and snag one by the tail.

Options abound in our world. You can choose where to stay and how to stay there. Where you are Today is as a result of the option you took yesterday and no doubt where you will be Tomorrow is embedded in your option Today. Choose right; choose wisely, Take THE BEST OPTION. The Best Option will deliver your inheritance to you. It will change your state and deliver to you, your brand new estate. You do not blame anyone for failing to do it right the first time. You accept the blame. The Best Option will cause you to get it right the first time and always.


When the Prince comes into your life, you will stop thinking and start reasoning.


Being poor in the Spirit means you are humble, gentle, meek, God-fearing,kind and exhibit the fruits of the Spirit but being Spiritually poor is lacking in every thing that pertains to life and godliness.


We all have 10,000 bad drawings in us. The sooner we get them out the better.


It has always been a happy thought to me that the creek runs on all night, new every minute, whether I wish it or know it or care, as a closed book on a shelf continues to whisper to itself its own inexhaustible tale. So many things have been shown so to me on these banks, so much light has illumined me by reflection here where the water comes down, that I can hardly believe that this grace never flags, that the pouring from ever-renewable sources is endless, impartial, and free.


One might almost say that an apparition is human vision corrected by divine love. I do not see you as you really are, Joseph; I see you through my affection for you. The Miracles of the Church seem to me not to rest so much upon faces or voices or healing power coming suddenly near to us from afar off, but upon our perceptions being made finer, so that for a moment our eyes can see and our ears can hear what is there about us always.

If we can write or sing or create in some way, even when we are dealing with difficulties or pain, then it becomes something bigger than ourselves  and often beautiful.


The movie Koyaanisqatsi shows non-commented time-lapse footage and focuses our attention on the very rhythm of our civilized modern life and nature. A marijuana high can do something for a user similar to what this time-lapse footage does. The enhancement of episodic memory and the acceleration of associative streams of memories can alter and enhance our recognition of patterns in our lives in various ways. If we are presented with quick associative chains of past experiences, we can see a pattern in a body of information that is usually not at once presented to our inner eye as such.


It has been my personal experience that as I allow the painting to speak I become lost, it is delicious and at the same time frightening. The best ones, to me, have a life of their own.


There is no ready vocabulary to describe the ways in which artists become artists, no recognition that artists must learn to be who they are (even as they cannot help being who they are.) We have a language that reflects how we learn to paint, but not how we learn to paint our paintings. How do you describe the [reader to place words here] that changes when craft swells to art?

You honor yourself by acting with dignity and composure.


The testimony of the greatest humans who have ever lived is that the way to make the most of ourselves is by transcending ourselves. We must learn to move beyond self-centeredness to make room within ourselves for others. When you transcend yourself, the fact will be confirmed by the quality of your life. We will attain – even if only momentarily – a transparency and a radiance of being which results from living both within and beyond yourself. This is the promise and the excitement of self-understanding.

For the scientist, at exactly the moment of discoverythat most unstable existential momentthe external world, nature itself, deeply confirms his innermost fantastic convictions. Anchored abruptly in the world, Leviathan gasping on his hook, he is saved from extreme mental disorder by the most profound affirmation of the real.


Creation is bringing potential into being, bringing inspiration into action. Inspiration and action are nothing when they are apart. Inspiration feels like a great a wondrous thing, but if it is not manifested, it is as if it never existed. Likewise, action without inspiration has no purpose. It is only when they are together as one that they are truly something.


Please don't entertain for a moment the utterly mistaken idea that there is no drudgery in writing. There is a great deal of drudgery in even the most inspired, the most noble, the most distinguished writing. Read what the great ones have said about their jobs; how they never sit down to their work without a sigh of distress and never get up from it witout a sigh of relief. Do you imagine that your Muse is forever flamelike -- breathing the inspired word, the wonderful situation, the superb solution into your attentive ear? ... Believe me, my poor boy, if you wait for inspiration in our set-up, you'll wait for ever.


I like to work in watercolor, with as little under-drawing as I can get away with. I like the unpredictability of a medium which is affected as much by humidity, gravity, the way that heavier particles in the wash settle into the undulations of the paper surface, as by whatever I wish to do with it. In other mediums you have more control, you are responsible for every mark on the page  but with watercolor you are in a dialogue with the paint, it responds to you and you respond to it in turn. Printmaking is also like this, it has an unpredictable element. This encourages an intuitive response, a spontaneity which allows magic to happen on the page. When I begin an illustration, I usually work up from small sketches  which indicate in a simple way something of the atmosphere or dynamics of an illustration; then I do drawings on a larger scale supported by studies from models  usually friends  if figures play a large part in the picture. When I've reached a stage where the drawing looks good enough I'll transfer it to watercolor paper, but I like to leave as much unresolved as possible before starting to put on washes. This allows for an interaction with the medium itself, a dialogue between me and the paint. Otherwise it is too much like painting by number, or a one-sided conversation.


There are reasons we congregate in these hot spots- to worship beauty and to feel its effects light up the electrolytes in the bloodstream.

I've been strongly influenced, in technique as well as subject matter, by some of the early 20th-century book illustrators  Arthur Rackham and Edmund Dulac in particular, Burne-Jones and other Pre-Raphaelites, and the Arts-&-Crafts movement they engendered. I'm continually inspired by Rembrandt, Breughel (I've wondered whether his brilliant Tower of Babel had inspired Tolkien's description of Minas Tyrith), Hieronymous Bosch, Albrecht Durer, and Turner; it's not necessarily that they influence my work in any particular direction, more that their example raises my spirits, re-affirms my belief in the power of images to move and delight us, and shows me how much further I have to go, how much is possible. Having visited Venice and Florence for the first time, I am besotted with the Italian Renaissance artists  Botticelli, Bellini, da Vinci and others. Their work is calm, controlled, and yet each face and landscape contains such passion. In Botticelli's paintings, every pebble and every leaf is rendered with a religious devotion; there is reverence inherent in paying such close attention to every stone, turning painting itself into a form of worship, an act of prayer.

Imagine that you are dying. If you had a terminal disease would you ­finish this book? Why not? The thing that annoys this 10-weeks-to-live self is the thing that is wrong with the book. So change it. Stop arguing with yourself. Change it. See? Easy. And no one had to die.


Writing is like sculpturing words out of a block of imagination. Sentences chisel the story, then characters make it their own.


What Waringa tried hard to avoid was looking at the pictures of the walls and windows of the church. Many of the pictures showed Jesus in the arms of the virgin Mary or on the cross. But others depicted the devil, with two cow-like horns and a tail like a monkey's, raising one leg in a dance of evil, while his angels, armed with burning pitchforks, turned over human beings on a bonfire. The Virgin Mary, Jesus and God's angels were white, like European, but the devil and his angels were black.


...Absorbed in the new scents, the sounds, and the sunlight...


As she stared at them, Waringa noted that their skins were indeed red, like that of pigs or like the skin of a black person who has been scalded with boiling water or who has burned himself with acid creams. Even the hair in their arms and necks stood out stiff and straight like the bristle of an aging hog.


In the same way there is much, much in all of us, but we do not know it. No one ever calls it out in us, unless we are lucky enough to know intelligent, imaginative, sympathetic people who love us and have the magnanimity to encourage us, to believe in us, by listening, by praise, by appreciation, by laughing. If you are going to write, you must become aware of this richness in you and come to believe in it and know it is there so that you can write opulently with with self-trust. Once you become aware of it, have faith in it, you will be all right. But it is like this: if you have a million dollars in the bank and don't know, it doesn't so you any good.


Devereaux is going with our pitch.

Novelty and Security: the security of novelty, the novelty of security. Always the full thing, the whole subject, the true subject, stood just behind the one you found yourself contemplating. The trick, but it wasn't a trick, was to take up at once the thing you saw and the reason you saw it as well; to always bite off more than you could chew, and then chew it. If it were self-indulgence for him to cut and polish his semiprecious memories, and yet seem like danger, like a struggle he was unfit for, then self-indulgence was a potent force, he must examine it, he must reckon with it.


Tomorrow is another opportunity to improve yourself


The words of his various writing instructors and professional mentors over the years came back to him at times like these, and he found a new understanding in their advice: Writing is rewriting. The rough draft is just that. You can't polish what you haven't written.

Mon Dieu donne-moi la sérénité d'accepter toutes les choses que je ne peux changer. Donne-moi le courage de changer les choses que je peux changer et la sagesse d'en connaître la différence.


Novelty. Security. Novelty wouldn't be a bad title. It had the grandness of abstraction, alerting the reader that large and thoughtful things were to be bodied forth. As yet he had no inkling of any incidents or characters that might occupy his theme; perhaps he never would. He could see though the book itself, he could feel its closed heft and see it opened, white pages comfortably large and shadowed gray by print; dense, numbered, full of meat. He sensed a narrative voice, speaking calmly and precisely, with immense assurance building, building; a voice too far off for him to hear, but speaking. (Novelty)


When he was in college, a famous poet made a useful distinction for him. He had drunk enough in the poet's company to be compelled to describe to him a poem he was thinking of. It would be a monologue of sorts, the self-contemplation of a student on a summer afternoon who is reading Euphues. The poem itself would be a subtle series of euphuisms, translating the heat, the day, the student's concerns, into symmetrical posies; translating even his contempt and boredom with that famously foolish book into a euphuism.

Senor Sempere believed that God lives, to a smaller or greater extent, in books, and that is why he devoted his life to sharing them, to protecting them, and to making sure their pages, like our memories and our desires, are never lost.


Children are our future. We teach them today; what will they do tomorrow?


We yearn for there to be meaning to our lives, balanced with a sense of inner peace & joy.


Scripture breathes wisdom like we breathe oxygen. It can't not. Through Scripture, God reveals himself. This wisdom cannot be captured, let alone contained, on a neon bumper sticker or rubber bracelet. Wisdom itself invites us to go deeper- right into a relationship with God himself.

Admirer quelqu'un, s'inspirer de son parcours, c'est avant tout grandir et devenir soi.

Religions are metaphorical systems that give us bigger containers in which to hold our lives. A spiritual life allows us to move beyond the ego into something more universal. Religious experience carries us outside of clock time into eternal time. We open ourselves into something more complete and beautiful. This bigger vista is perhaps the most magnificent aspect of a religious experience.

There are things you can change, the ones you can accomodate the ones you must avoid and the ones you definitely cannot do anything about. If you surrender all of them to JESUS the LORD, HE would give you Peace and Love in return.

I feel like a millionaire on the back of an armored jet-ski my samurai girlfriend who loves me is charging at a cartel speedboat to win a game of chicken. Isn't this the day's best part? You don't even have to remember to enjoy it. It enjoys you into itself.


We all are rich and ignore the buried fact of accumulated wisdom.


Without devotion any life becomes a stranger's story...told for the body to forget what it once loved.


When the horror recedes and the world resumes its normal shape, you cannot forget it. You have seen what is really there, the empty horror that exists when the consoling illusion of our mundane experience is stripped away, so you can never respond to the world in quite the same way again.

No wizard has ever made himself useful by magic, or, if they've tried, they've only made matters worse. No wizard ever stopped a war or mended a fence. It's better that they stay in their marshes, out of the way of worldly folk like farmers and soldiers and merchants and kings.


The Nobel Prize is the best thing that can happen to a writer in terms of how it affects your contracts, the publishers, and the seriousness with which your work is taken. On the other hand, it does interfere with your private life, or it can if you let it, and it has zero effect on the writing.It doesn't help you write better and if you let it, it will intimidate you about future projects.


The Legend of the Firefish,first in the Trophy Chase Trilogy by George Bryan Polivka, is a winner....filled with action,adventure, danger, intrigue,surprise,suspense....The characters Polivka created are fresh and interesting....A must read for fantasy lovers, and a highly recommended drating for others who want a good story.

To be communal is to be something fallacious. It is to be something more or less than being, a subjugation or propagation of the self to exist within the external condition.


For this will cure him that is sick, and rouse him that is in dumps; one that has loved, it will remember of it; one that has not, it will instruct. For there was never any yet that wholly could escape love, and never shall there be any, never so long as beauty shall be, never so long as eyes can see. But help me that God to write the passions of others; and while I write, keep me in my own right wits.


If people are troubled by their view, they ought to offer these New Orleanians, and black and poor people in the places like the Lower Ninth Ward around the country, a reason to believe otherwise.


If your creation is taking 99% perspiration, it stinks and you need more inspiration.


His (Samuel Coleridge) dark senses were constantly in play, the frustration of them bringing illness. Weather and organic nature combined in a synaesthetic multi-media event, and this was the ground of all perception before it was divded up in daily living: the Primary Imagination giving way to the Secondary. Poetry was forever seeking a conscious return to this state, which existed all the time, whether he knew it or not.


For, what is order without common sense, but Bedlam's front parlor? What is imagination without common sense, but the aspiration to out-dandy Beau Brummell with nothing but a bit of faded muslin and a limp cravat? What is Creation without common sense, but a scandalous thing without form or function, like a matron with half a dozen unattached daughters?

Data that comes subliminally and is acted upon will look like luck or inspiration.

Tonight I saw Jesus with the eyes on my face. He looks half lion and half man. But not more like a lion and not more like a man, rather the same, I have never seen anything like the face of Jesus before, %100 one thing but %100 another thing: a lion man! Where did you see Him at? On the surface of my blanket as I lay in bed. He was suddenly drawn onto it, like a sketch, and that same moment I knew He was showing His face to me, finally. Why do you think He did that? I think He thought it was about time.

To hope is to gamble. It's to bet on your futures, on your desires, on the possibility that an open heart and uncertainty is better than gloom and safety. To hope is dangerous, and yet it is the opposite of fear, for to live is to risk.


You can hear a song in every word if you listen closely enough.


How is it

To live a life without awakening is to leave it as it was begun.


The difference between a fairly interesting writer and a fascinating writer is that the fascinating writer has a better nose for what genuinely excites him, he is hotter on the trail, he has a better instinct for what is truly alive in him. The worse writer may seem to be more sensible in many ways, but he is less sensible in this vital matter: he cannot distinguish what is full of life from what is only half full or empty of it. And so his writing is less alive, and as a writer he is less alive, and in writing, as in everything else, nothing matters but life.


Nobody is, was, will be born smart. But for you to be smart, and act smart, you need to think smart always. It is not a subject of your alma mater, it is the side and fries of what the genius within can comprehend, comply and captivate. In every beginning has a twelve kick start, promotion of the relativity of your new thinking, the story of a bunch of math and the spirit of a wonder apple.


Recognizing your own progress is a huge part of feeling motivated to do more. Your brain is a great tool for your success. It is hard at work and automating the new things you are doing even when you are taking a break.

Obedience is an unpopular word nowadays, but the artist must be obedient to the work, whether it be a symphony, a painting, or a story for a small child. I believe that each work of art, whether it is a work of great genius or something very small, comes to the artist and says, Here I am, Enflesh me. Give birth to me. And the artist either says, My soul doth magnify the Lord, and willingly becomes the bearer of the work, or refuses; but the obedient response is not necessarily a conscious one, and not everyone has the humble, courageous obedience of Mary.


I'm happiest when I'm with young people. Their wisdom, grief, and optimism motivates me to work harder – and inspires me to be better, more thoughtful and to move with increased reverence. I find joy in children.


He laughed. I had made a joke, apparently. What difference makes what you believe? What happens will happen anyway, exactly the same, no matter what you believe. What you do makes the important part. What you do.


Carrying a grudge in your heart or in your mind is like carrying a bunch of thorns on your body. You are just choosing to prick yourself with it.


no one needs love from you

​Have pleasure from the pursuit.


Look at yourselfAre your eyes Twinkling? Is your heart Dancing? Are your lips Smiling? If yes, then you are truly enjoying Life.


In order for you to live life like its golden. You have to love the life that your living.


It would be arrogant of us to think that we exist in a world created specifically for us and that knowing the reality we live in is unnecessary.


The greatest war in our lives is the one against our own fears and illusions. We fight countless battles with our deluded consciousness which sometimes strives for making not the best, but the safest and least risky decisions.

Theres a remarkable amount of strength residing in those who move forward without being able to physically move. Ones that carry the weight of illness or a disability, they battle wars most know nothing about. They are the true warriors of the world, the ones who have every reason to quit but never do.


Localisation stands, at best, at the limits of practical possibility, but it has the decisive argument in its favour that there will be no alternative.


You didn't find strength when you couldn't live without it. You found it when you had someone or something you loved so much that it forced you to stretch the edges of yourself further than you thought was possible.


Autumn is my favourite season of all. It is a transitory period that allows the earth to rest before it sees the harshness of winter and hears the promise of spring.


With Time, you can create Money, but with Money you cannot create Time. So Time is more valuable than Money.


Nothing in this world is Good or Bad. Our thinking makes it so. A knife is good when a surgeon uses it to save a life & bad when a terrorist uses it to kill.


Too many people stop dreaming about what life could be and just focus on survival. It doesn't have to be that way. The size of your bank account or level of education doesn't matter when it comes to dreaming.


Instead of trying to understand Life, we must live it. Create a reason to Live and progress on that path every day.


Introspect! Is your life moving forward or just moving like a pendulum?


Stop trying to explain yourself. People only understand things from their level of perception; within the parameters of their agreement with reality. Save your energy.


The girl was a gypsy before an illness took control of her legs, now she watches in awe the world pass by whilst stillness teaches her about inner strength.


There is no certainty, not even your next breath.

It is better to fail at perfection than it is to succeed at mediocrity.


Write for a cause,

No one has any right to tell you that the way you perceive yourself is wrong. Because by doing so, they also discourage the person you aspire to be.


For the sake of the aftermath.


It is ironic that we are particular about flushing out all the dirt through the Drain, but we continue to retain a lot of it in our Brain.


Creativity bleeds from the pen of inspiration.


They go to Paris to learn how to make bombs and they come back having learned only how to write poetry, which they think is more explosive.

Assess your days and reconcile the differences. Repeat steps to success and dispose bad habits.


In life, some laugh, some cry, some live, some die. The choice is ours to crawl or to fly.


What I am going to propose is that you write a novel.

For that is what you are, that is who you are – you are an author. You cannot cease to write any more than you can cease to breathe...This difficult season will pass – your eyes and mind will inevitably be opened once more to the wealth of ideas all around you...And even if the ideas around you fall short of what you seek – even if, as you say, you have not the heart to write... perhaps it is your heart you ought to write of. - Laurie to Jo, on writing


Kita tidak perlu merisaukan masalah yang ada, yang perlu kita pikirkan adalah bagaimana jawaban kita dalam mengatasi masalah tersebut. Semudah apapun kesulitan dan masalah yang ada menjadi percuma jika respon kita salah. Sebaliknya, seberat apapun masalah tak jadi soal jika jawaban yang kita berikan benar



Let it shine, the light in you.

Sesungguhnya masalah yang ada itu juga untuk membuat manusia sadar, agar tidak terlalu berlebihan dalam hidup. Jika mendapat nikmat jangan terlalu bahagia, namun secukupnya saja. Juga ketika mendapat musibah jangan terlalu bersedih, namun secukupnya saja


Without passion man is a mere latent force and possibility, like the flint which awaits the shock of the iron before it can give forth its spark.


I have learned that chances don't always come to you; sometimes you have to create your own.


There is no past, present, or future; there is only meow, right meow, and what you do with your one shot at life.


I Love the Smell of Success in the Shadows of Failure.

If I don't hold myself to the highest standards, who will?


Wake up in the morning and get into each day, living it in a way that will make you happy and gay.


Many people are hurt in Life. But the problem is not the hurt. They Curse, Nurse, and Rehearse their hurt instead of Reversing it, and Live miserably.


I'm not going to tear you down... If you're bad-mouthing me, you're already down.


Don't compromise your integrity; whatever you gain won't be worth as much as what you lose.

A good life is the balance between despair and dancing.


Ask yourself this question: 'Will this matter a year from now?


We write because the blank piece of paper and the pen are there. We write because this is our addiction and we are proud of it. Our habit, our drug, our crutch. Whatever you wish to call it. We write because since an early age we felt it deep in our souls and in our bones. The poem must be written, the story must be told and the new myths and Gods are waiting for you to bring them forth from out of the darkness and to bring them into the light of being. You are a creator, so create. You are the writer. So write.


If you haven't arrived yet, keep driving, your destiny is waiting for you.


Fear will hunt you down right to the very depth of your soul


Not all things that fall down break. Some develop wings.


Far more than the shield is the Pleasure I get on the field . . . the Joy of the chase is greater than the result of the race.


Oh, of course I stumble. There are times when I'm confidently skipping along and then I trip over my own poorly-placed steps and fall face first into the thickets. But I think there's a sort of beauty in falling. Each time I fall, I'm reminded that I'm still human, that I'm still learning, that there will always be more lessons, growth, and discovery up ahead. So, although I have times when I'm weak, when I'm critical of myself, or I lose hope, I wouldn't give them up for the world. I cherish them – because it's the risk of falling that makes life a grand adventure rather than just a guided tour.


When your shoulds finally become musts, that's when you will achieve great change in your life.


There are 3 ways of handling a situation. You can either become part of the problem, part of the solution or part of the pavement..

Of what use is my going to church every day and still come home and remain the same? Of what use is my attending the mosques and the next day I enter the mall with knives and start slaughtering people in the name of religion.

I would rather have a man chasing JESUS than a house full of stuffs and garrage filled with big cars.


There must always be an opposition because the enemy always opposes what the Lord has declared.


God always sees me with no make-ups on because He knew how we started.

What is this love

We can wait for that inner inspiration to come or we can actively cultivate it. The choice is ours. Choosing to actively cultivate the inner inspiration of the heart is Heartfulness.


If we dare to ask, GOD will dare to answer.


I am amazed upon the many battle that we engage in, be it money, control or matters of the heart, only very few of us knows how to fight in the right way or understand who we are really fighting against. To win any battle you' ve got to have the right strategy and resources because victories don't come by accident.

LA IDEA ES IMMORTAL

Can a book make such a difference? Can it change you utterly?

Cry, laugh, sing, cuss all you want but all the while dig the a hole with precision, till it is completed- and then move on.....


GOD is faithful and that is true. But I'll tell you what, GOD is even more faithful to the faithful.


I do not have any trust fund, I have always trusted God for all my funds.


Rather than wasting time on yesterday that is gone, it is better to invest your time in Tomorrow that is not yet born.


The simplest way to Rejoice is to Count your Blessings and be grateful for them. You will automatically feel Joy in your Heart.


Why wait to get old and dream about the things you could have done, when you can start now and dream about the things you will do.


We have come to the determination to die, all of us, rather than abandon our God, and our religion.


Parents never you make church and studying the word of God optional for your children. If they are in your house, get them up, teach them the word of God, the greatest awards, PhD or achievements any child could have is to grow up in the word of God. I and my family are living witness and it is extending to our third generation.


Be careful because God's gifts alone are not able to give you joy; God's gift can only bring you joy when they are joined with your gratitude.


Whenever you are in transition it is always important to choose the words that you use. You call it crises in your life and I call it transition.


All the failures in my life freed me from all my fears so that I can succeed.


I don't want to settle down because God has satisfied me and heard my prayers. I want to stay hungry and thirsty for the things of God.


Be careful the mistake of yesterday always lives with tomorrow.


This is not the first time that the world has been in a mess but you are still God, you left us on the earth, not only to preach in a building but to be the church beyond the buildings.


At a time like this maybe the world is looking at us not just at a miracle crusade or sunday church service but the way we are living. Maybe they want to see whether what our Master left for us worked for us; there is a counter spirit to the spirit of fear, it is the love of God.


God always wants us to see things from heaven's prospective. You may not be doing much to your community but what you are is so important. You are significant.


Christians we cannot be allowed to be fractured at a time like this. There are more of us, there are more of light in us than in the agents of darkness.


If you never listen, you can't see. The devil has got so many people so disconnected that they cannot even listen or even sense when the Lord is speaking.


Before we can fix the situation, we have to first see the situation, the world can't see straight right now, some are blinded by hatred, rage, fear, scepticism, some are blinded by their pains.

The agenda of the Media is not to inform you, they don't care about you, they are trying to show you the truth. There are some intelligent Christians but they can't find them and put on the air ...for instance me


There must be something that God knows about fear that we don't know. I am sure He knows that when you are in a state of fear, you can't fix anything. When we are in a state of fear we can't talk about anything reasonable and we can't solve anything. That is the problem because the media throws all lies on us to create fear and we fall for it....Number one Satan's strategy of getting some people trapped.


Sometimes what not to do is more important than what to do. Sometimes when you are in crisis, when frustration are high or when you are under pressure, what you don't do is more important than what you do. Don't be afraid. ....


How about we be the light of Jesus Christ? There are things we tend to forget when fear becomes the driving force. The world is filled with a lot of questions now; what do we do? Who do we elect? How do we fix this? Some people feel powetless in those ways. Helpless, hopeless, confused, overwhelmed.

I am a bit old fashion but I believe in prayer, I believe prayer can move mountain. Prayer might not be our responsibility but it is a good starting place. It can give us heaven's prospectives on human problems. I know we need to do a bit more than pray but that doesn't mean we don't need to pray.


The presence of crisis does not prove the absence of God. I think in time of crisis Christians should rise up and point to the world on something bigger. The crisis is an opportunity for us to proclaim to the children of darkness what we proclaim in the light.


Man's panic does not produce God's power.....sometimes you need to pray before you post on social media.


Five minutes after something happened might not be the best time for you to get into your Facebook and tell everybody. Men's panic does not produce God's power.


Conflict is much the same, injustice and inequality is nothing new to our generation only the contest has changed because not only that everyone has opinion but they also have an opportunity to voice it and that is a bit dangerous.


The conflict hasn't gotten worst but the contest has really changed...


I have the word of God and my bible is very interesting, this book was conceived in battle, Jesus Christ our Saviour was conceived in brokenness, out of barenness to redeem a people who were in bondage to their sin. I know exactly where to go when the people start getting confused, trading lies for truth, buying injustice for justice and even when the media starts to show me the prospectives of the world that I am living in, I have my prospective from the word of God.


I am so happy that I grew up knowing the word of God, the spirit of discernment in me is 24hrs activated, I can differentiate between light and darkness. I put on the amour of God even when the whole world is going to hell, I refuse to join them. The light in me shall overshadow every power of darkness.


All of my life God has allowed me to share prospectives with people who are different. You cannot lead people whose prospective you are not willing to understand.


Surrounded by enemies, surrounded by evil, surrounded by darkness, injustice.......don't be afraid , those who are with us are more than those who are with them

Whenever someone is a threat to the enemy there will be an attack dispatched against that person to try to minimise their effectiveness.


There is power in the word of God if used properly.


There is a remedy and there is a hope but the remedy is not in the political party or in places that will take you away from hope. You better run to God, that is the only place you can find both.


My advice for those of you who felt being marginalised, undervalued and taken for granted; guess what? That is the Arena where God creates Leaders.


I didn't come from a success lineage but I am so glad that my earthly lineage is not my final story because when I gave my life to Jesus twelve years back, God interrupted my story.


How is it

You may have fallen down, but you can get back up again. You may have doors shut, but new doors will open for you. You may have been lied on, but the truth will come to the light. You may have been hurt, but the pain will pass. You are a survivor. You have a history of surviving.


Sometimes to change a situation you are in requires you to take a giant leap. But, you won't be able to fly unless you are willing to transform.


Why didn't you write all this time?

Like a pair of old slippers,

Have you heard the love story

What is the point of a relationship if not to grant two people the very private privilege to uplift one another every day? To illuminate the qualities in each other that are diamonds of shimmering beauty. To appreciate wholeheartedly. To accept unconditionally. And to love eternally, even in moments of dislike. I'm not here to grant you the extraordinary love you never had for yourself. I'm here, on my own accord, to love you. So that when you stare into my mirror eyes, you may see how extraordinary you are.


You think that you've moved on.

All my pains has always increased my sense of purpose.


I can sense your love,

Never allow yourself to be defined by some else's opinion of you....unless they hold a higher opinion of you than you have for yourself.


You must be present in the present to make it a present.


Don't be afraid of being Happy. You deserve to be Happy.


When you do away with God you become your own god, because you recognise no greater power in the universe than yourself.


I have graduated to the extent of not asking what is happening in my life because I trust the maker(God).


Does God know

I have my priorities and I know my purpose. I do not Praise God because of my pain but I praise Him because of what the pain is producing.


If you can feed in the presence of your enemies, if you can be blessed under the weight of burdens, when you praise God in pain, it is preparation for provision.


When you praise God in pain, it is preparing you for provision.


The things I call crisis and all the things that were coming after me are all coming to serve the purpose of God in my life.


God made my enemies to serve me in my absence. God made the things that conspired to destroy me feed me into the place that He was preparing for me. I am a big girl and I can handle trouble and my enemies.


When you learn to have the heart of praise in the presence of your enemies, you set the table; if you can work with God in darkness enough depending on the light that He showed you in the last season, you will learn to read your enemies as a sign that it is time to eat. ( a bit deep). Whenever you sense a crisis in your life, note that your harvest is near.


God prepared a table before me in the presence of my insecurity, in the presence of my deficits, in the presence of my addictions, in the presence of my confusions, in the presence of what I have lost, in the presence of the threat that I won't make it, in the presence of my enemies, I am looking straight ahead.


Learn to eat with your enemies all around you but most of all thank God for his presence. Keep your eyes fixed to the presence of God in the presence of your enemies.


I have learned to thank God for what I cannot see, I have learned to trust God with what I cannot.


Thank God #EVEN# #THOUGH# in bad times not only in your good; this is a graduated form of gratitude.


Gratitude without practicing maybe like practicing a faith without good work. A grateful heart is not enough without a grateful habit; because your joy is not produced by what you put in your heart but by habit you put in your life.


If God gives you a gift and you don't know what to do with it, it won't make you happy. Some of you God gave a wonderful husband but you can't make a home and some of you God gave a wonderful wife but you can't make a good husband. Some of you can't even unwrap the gift so that you can appreciate it.


Maybe what you need in your life is not the next level of accomplishment or the next level of accumulation but the next level of appreciation for what you have; that will set the stage to make a space for what you will accumulate in the future. ( a bit deep) Simply put thank God for now before setting the goal for tomorrow because if you grow in gifts and didn't grow in gratitude, you have gained nothing.


Do you know that you can be surrounded by all these blessings, all these relationships, goodness, provisions, opportunities? But if you don't know how to turn the blessing into praise, it will turn into pride and your life will never be filled with joy because your heart has holes in it.


Humility is never about being small, unseen and unnoticed. Humility is really about expressing all the wonder you are in a way that all people see is the awesomeness and greatness of GOD.


The greatest thing about me isn't even a part of me. It's you.


The first problem of any kind of even limited success is the unshakable conviction that you are getting away with something, and that at any moment now they will discover you. It's Imposter Syndrome, something my wife Amanda christened The Fraud Police.

Look where YOU have been; view where YOU are at; seek where YOU want to be.


And then one day you realise that if you want to be rich, you'd have to give away almost everything you own.


Once your soul is awakened, you never return to the sleepwalking state of mind. Some people become complacent in life. They are just going through the motions and not aware of truth. Seek the knowledge, wisdom, and the understandings that vivify your existence.


There are two powerful fuels, two forces; motivation and inspiration. To be motivated you need to know what your motives are. Over time - and to sustain you through it - your motivation must become an inner energy; a 'motor' driving you forward, passionately, purposefully, wisely and compassionately... come what may, every day. Inspiration is an outer - worldly - energy that you breathe and draw in. It may come from many places, faces, spaces and stages - right across the ages. It is where nature, spirit, science, mind and time meet, dance, play and speak. It keeps you outward facing and life embracing. But you must be open-minded and open-hearted to first let it in and then let it out again. Together - blended, combined and re-entwined - motivation and inspiration bring connectivity, productivity, creativity and boundless possibilities that is not just 'self' serving but enriching to all humanity and societies...just as it should be.


An artist is someone who sees and feels realty very intensely. Creativity doesn't mean just making things up out of thin air. It means seeing and feeling the world so vividly that you can put together connections and patterns that help to explain reality. It means you see the beauty in the world rather than trying to hide from it.


The impact of your life will go beyond your imagination. Live your life to be a blessing.


This day is full of extraordinary things that you are missing. Wonderful sights, like the sun on your counterpane, the hairs on your cat's tail, the cracks in the paint on your radiator, the leaves piling up against the curve. Wonderful smells, wonderful sounds. Wonderful people. Wonderful opportunities. Today is wonderful. But perhaps you have lost your sense of wonder.


We are all born extraordinary! shape your today to cherish your tomorrow


In life, you either choose to be a powerleess victim or one of the choosen ones, who now has the power to understand the pain of others.


Art is about going a little nuts and justifying the next sentence.


Those who always think of their aches can never do what it takes!


Tisina je moj maternji jezik.


Restyle your life forever by empowering yourself to incite the greatness in you


Celebrate your life now, as it unfolds.

Life is a maze. Don't just gaze. Change your pace, to win the race.


Everyone deserves something so much better than what they deserve.


We don't know Where God is, Who God is or What God is... BUT GOD IS!


Don't stop before your miracle happens


When the world gets too loud and seems to move too fast, I slow down my inner world and look deep into the natural caverns of myself and swim in the cooling waters which lay waiting for me to wade deeply in. I sip of honeyed dew drops with my heart beat slowing down, my pulse calming and becoming tranquil. I no longer am a part of the massive world of eternal speed and endless flirtations with chance and hazardous circumstance. I have become a quiet observer to the natural order of reality and life's boundless possibilities. This lets me know that I have reached a point of understanding more than mortality but also immortality. I can feel the drops of warm rain bouncing off my skin and the birds squawking in the background seeking to fly in the endless sky between the multicolored droplets of eternity.﻿

Life is short; love is longer.


Everybody has to die. Why cry, when you have wings to fly!


I've written you sixty-seven love poems.

Something watches over us and we know it when we follow the little voice inside or heed the warning or inspiration that arrives as if on wings. We need the intermediaries that keep us close to the spirit of life, to the wonders of nature and to the subtleties of our own inner nature.


It does not need to be perfect - or technically correct - to be magic


Do not allow your happiness to be controlled by the thoughts of others. People are happy for you one minute and then the next they are looking down their noses at you. You have to find within yourself the kind of happiness that withstands the ups and downs of life. No one should have the power to limit or repress your happiness.


I would rather live 10 years doing what I Love, than drag through Life 50 years, hating everyday I Live.


God can take the ordinary and create the extraordinary. Our incredible God has the power to transform your simple life and give you the life of your dreams. Remarkable things happen in your life when you believe.


Let go of something old that no longer serves you to make room for something new.


They took one look at me,

If you want to make room for something new, you must let go of something old that no longer serves you.


While passing through an obscure nook of Notre Dame cathedral, Victor Hugo noticed the Greek work for fate carved in the stone. He imagined a tormented soul driven to engrave this word. From this seed sprang his monumental novel The Hunchback of Notre Dame.


Character. Intelligence. Strength. Style. That makes beauty.


Don't be so hard on yourself. Be perfectly okay with being who YOU are. Fully embrace yourself, flaws and all. Love yourself right where you are. Strive to do better, but don't beat yourself up for every shortcoming that you may have. Be brave in your journey! Hold your head up high, and keep moving forward.


There is more things in heaven and earth...than are dreamt of by your philosophy.


Christ's Atonement provides more than an opportunity to live a happy life later; it promises and provides for a remarkable life now.


God is working on your behalf, for your happiness and inner peace. So move forward in faith, believing that He is with you and for you because He is.


An abundant life is one where we are physically strong, mentally sound, and spiritually aflame. I


We tend to see what we are looking for.


Yes, the same God who created all the universes created you as a one-of-a-kind. He knows you and loves you and commands you to love yourself.


Jesus took care of himself. He ate healthy food. He rested when he was weary. He sought time alone when he needed to recharge. He laughed with his friends. He wept when he was sad. He walked long distances and climbed hills and moved. From barren wilderness to unpredictable waters, he spent the majority of his time outside in nature. He loved wholeheartedly. He served others. He cooked. He studied and learned and grew in wisdom. Jesus cared for himself physically, mentally and spiritually.

Every time we choose our past over our present, we kill our future.


To be fearless, you must simply fear less.


Ljubav se moze pojaviti u najcudnijim oblicima.

They say copying is a form of flattery, I say it's lack of originality.


I didn't want to want what I wanted. I wanted to want what He wanted for me.


It's not what we do onceit's what we do once a day...day in and day out...every day that brings lasting change into our lives.


Look around! People have faces with no smiles, as if they are carrying heavy baggage. Stop them! Give them a SMILE and see them Light up.


The moment you believe your experience is caused by other people, you are giving them your power.


I am a living breathing word of GOD.


Open your heart to the wonder of life simply by opening your heart.


Successful people aren't born that way. They usually work very hard, and that means constant effort – even if it's not hard, it is steady. People born to wealth need to work to keep it. A radical shift means a thousand small changes, a few a day. Eventually you wake up...

A radical shift in attitude happens in small steps. It's a transformation. A butterfly does a lot of walking and eating and growing before it finally forms a chrysalis and emerges with wings. It's not an instant transformation.


If we want a miracle, we've got to surrender all our faith.


Sometimes even the best of us have to lose ourselves in fantasy to survive reality.


I didn't come looking for you the day you uninvitedly appeared on my doorstep

Let go and let God. Don't dwell on your past mistakes. When you do that, your past keeps you from moving forward. The wonder of the Atonement is that you don't have to be the same person you were yesterday, last year or even a minute ago. Through Christ, and through the power of repentance, you are continually being reborn.


If you let anyone tie your Wings with Strings, you can never Fly in the Sky! Your Independence, Your Freedom is Your Biggest Gift.


Nothing takes you away from dwelling in the past or worrying about the future like living in the present.


Be happy about your own life and you'll be amazed at just how much more beautiful you'll find it to be.


You push the TRUTH off a cliff, but it will always fly. You can submerge the TRUTH under water, but it will not drown. You can place the TRUTH in the fire, but it will survive. You can bury the TRUTH beneath the ground, but it will arise. TRUTH always prevails!


I'm a lover not a fighter. But when I have to fight, I fight to win. There cannot be another outcome.


Mortality was never designed to torture you. It was designed to test you.


I Am ! Two powerful words.... You must confess... I Am who God called me to be. I Am a Success. I Am not what you think of me. I Am more than a conqueror. I Am walking by Faith. I Am a Gift.


Your past isn't there to decide who you are; it's there to guide you to a better version of yourself.


Knowledge deepens with experience.


Knock. Pound on heaven's door if you have to, but don't give up. God hears all sincere prayers.


You are wise only if despite of being capable of taking a revenge & holding onto a grudge, you choose to forgive!


Whatever GOD creates, GOD sustains.


GOD doesn't love you until, He loves you yet still


Despair and disappointment are the parent of countless inspired, inspiring, triumphant creations


Like a feather in the air, like a leaf in the sea, I surrender to Thee, I surrender to Thee.


Unless and until we change, we cannot grow. What's life without growth?


Every time we choose our past over our present we kill our future.


My mother smoked two packs of cigarettes a day. Before she smoked her first cigarette, she was free to choose whether or not she would smoke. After awhile, her freedom reverted to Satanso it would seem. The choice was no longer hersso it would seem. Her mind and body were attacked with nicotine cravings that got so bad she would sometimes sacavage through garbage cans for butts when she'd run short on full cigarettes.

It does not matter where you arefrom this very moment on you choose the direction of your life.


Just because we've made poor or wrong choices in the past, does not limit us from making wise and good choices now.


As long as we follow the lead of our hearts with love, we will be in step with our destiny.


We never quite see ourselves as others see us.


Once we give up the need for perfection, we find amazing connections with each other.


God will always watch out for our best, providing us with what we need and a soft landing when we seem to be falling.


Bring on the people you want me to love, the situations you want me to take on, and the lessons you want me to learn.


I will live each minute in gratitude.


We may all be on the same journey but not necessarily on the same road.


Think Big. Dream BIGGER


Nothing on this earth will empower you or change you more than knowing without doubt that God loves you.


Do you realize that you have the power to design a life that's meaningful and even remarkable? You and God are in a family partnership. He has not only blessed you with mortal breath, but with a purpose-filled life. He's given you power and will to control that life. This is a gift that He will never take from you. But when you humble yourself and give your will back to him, your life will be nothing short of miraculous.


Positive minds full of faith and hope produce positive lives.


You have what others crave to have,

Life has taught me that money is important, but it's not everything. For, if I have all the money in the world, but no time to enjoy, of what use is it?


I love you...it's so easy to say,

...about a spiritual path, seeing the validity in all paths, and knowing that religion can help or hamper the path. The teachings in every religion are valuable. It is humanity that has bogged down in dogma and rules. Loving and practicing the teachings that ring true is the key.


Expressing intense feelings usually portends better results than emotional detachment does.


One of the greatest challenge in life is not having an attitude but knowing or accepting that you have one


You still have time..get up,

We all are victims of our life,

We don't just grow old. We become old when we stop growing.


If you can control jealousy and praise people,

It's okay to lose..it's not a crime,

[Patricia Highsmith] went on to recommend that aspiring writers keep a notebook in which to jot down thoughts or ideas, that they should trust in the power of the unconscious and that they shouldn't force inspiration. In addition, it was important to avoid those who negated the creative process, sometimes people

No matter where you are along life's path, your next step is your first step.


The only way to take command of your life is to realize that you are never going to be in control of it.


Experience is a supreme teacher, but experience is not something that can be taught. It has to be learned through choice and consequence.


Inevitably, mistakes are going to happen, sin is going to win a round or two in the battle of life, but there is always, always, always a way back because Jesus Christ has our backs.


The is no such thing as a coincidence, only Godincidence


Dance bravely into your own heart, and you will find the love of all.


If something happens that causes you Pain, remind yourself that you can't get the Rainbow without a little Rain.


If you truly love them don't leave them,

A change of attitude is the one change that changes everything


Nothing. Nothing. Nothing is more powerful in deciding the quality of life than attitude.


An attitude is much deeper than just our emotions or the thoughts we think. It's a decision we make based on our core beliefs and values.


An attitude is more important that circumstances. More powerful than the past, education, finances, successes, failures, or opinions. Attitude can make or break any situation. So when you face a problem remember that your problem is not your problem. Your real problem is your attitude toward your problem. Because your attitude reveals the real you, it determines your successes and failures in every undertaking.


An aware heart is a grateful heart.


When we take our doubts and questions to Christ, we get truthful answers. We get complete answers. We get the love, wisdom, and support we need.


We forget that the power of God isn't in a weapon or a leader, but within us.


An attitude adjustment from the inside out is what it will take to get you to change direction. The truth is God is on your side, no matter how far you've wandered. He still loves you. He still needs you. Your sins don't define you. He does.


Being meek does not make you weak. You're not someone who sways with changing circumstances. You don't allow yourself to be used. You're not passive or spineless. Your faith is in the Almighty, so you know that you are mighty.


When we go through life believing that we need mercy, we're more likely to extend it. As humans our tendency is to want justice for others, but mercy for ourselves.

Let your BE inform your DO.


Sometimes all the players get a bad hand. You just have to be determined enough to see the game through.


People run around looking for millions of likes in their life and on the social media but do you know what? If you get just one true like from just one who loves you the most, it surpasses all other millions. God loves you the most even without make over.


What is your motive when you go to church? To feed or to be fed? To serve or to be served? To worship or to be worshipped? To praise or to be praised? To teach or to learn? To give or to receive?

Why do people go to church on Sundays? A question that is very complicated because I know what the answer is supposed to be but I do not really know the answer.

I don't just have only the peace of God, I do also have a God who gives peace, not just resources but the revelation of His presence.


Be anxious for no thing, be concerned about the state of your soul and that of your children, be concerned about God's work in the world; these are genuine concern but when it comes to the things in your life.....be not anxious. If God is for us who can be against us?


Don't think because you can't affect something at a great level that God can't use you in a great way. David didn't even train one day with the armies but He won the war. He didn't even have a weapon but he killed a giant.


God wants to use you right where you are with what you have not what you do not have.


Sometimes God wraps destiny in what we perceive as just another day. The same day that David's father asked him to go and deliver bread to his brothers in the field was the same day that God used him to bring goliath down. Take every minute in your life serious.


Some people want to kill goliath but they do not want to attend to sheep. How can God use you to kill giants if you cannot follow simple instructions?


Sometimes we want God to use us to do big things when we would not even want to do the basics.


You don't have to position yourself in front of people to be used by God. You don't have to convince anyone that you are good enough for the voice of God, just be grateful that God chooses who He wills and once He is ready to use you, no devil in hell can stop Him.


You can't disappoint what God has appointed.


If you can't see the assets in you, it will be hard for you to export it to the world. Recognise who you are and the world will recognise you.


Blind barthimus used his mouth and his feet to affect what wasn't working in his life? What do you use to affect what's not working in your life? God is not interested in your perfection, He is interested in your participation. It is your participation that attracts the presence of God.


In God's presence I find peace that is much deeper than any disappointment. I will grow and I understand I can't grow myself, that is why I need God and His grace.


We are all planted in God's vineyard and our lives are filled with potentials and purpose and we have all been given the hopes to anchor our lives even in the most disappointed times. So God is waiting to see what you and I will make out of the raw materials that He has given to us. He is waiting to see what we will make out of the discouragement and disappointment. I believe that in those deepest places of disappointment that the greatest grace will manifest.


I am so glad that God's disappointment in me is not greater than his love and I still have a Destiny. I am growing in grace and mercy because that is the only soil that can produce the kind of life that God desires.


You will always end up in frustration whenever you try to produce outside your purpose.


Some people are disappointed in their life because they are trying to use the tools that God did not authorised them to use in their life, trying to build on a purpose that is not even attached in their personality.


In God's Kingdom there are no overnight sensations or flash-in-the-pan successes.

Dance before the music is over. Live before your Life is over.


Remember diamonds are created under pressure so hold on, it will be your time to shine soon.


(I watched a video recently which explains that karma is not just what you do..it's what you think..what you see...what you hear..what you speak. Eg: If I listen to a motivational speech on youtube, my karma is good. If I listen to a hate speech, my karma is bad! Thus, every second, we are performing Karma! So I penned down this poem on Karma)

Courage emerges as you climb over the circumstances that threaten to bury you! But you must be willing to climb to find courage.


Have you ever asked yourself this question what can God do through me? The preacher has no platform if the people has no sense of mission.


YOU... are a portal to the divine.


In dealing with us, God always starts with our motives. What do you want for the people? What does God wants for his people? What do you want Him to do for you; that's is a starting place.


give me a reason to get back to myself ,to return again .


Do you know where your breakthrough begins? Your breakthrough begins where your excuses ends.


Sometimes the fact that you can't sense God isn't an indication that He is not there. It is just an indication that you are hanging out in the wrong place.The cave is not a physical location, it is a state of mind.


God takes two and make them one but satan takes one and make it two.


For those of you who are begging God for a breakthrough, this is not the way of getting something from your heavenly father, you don't have to beg him for what He already bought for you, you don't have to beg Him for what He died to give you. You don't have to convince people, you don't have to convince anybody if God likes to do a work in your life, it is done.


The more desperate the situation, the more opportunity for miracle. If you need something from God, you need to be at the right place, the right position and at the right time


Do you want to feel better or do you want to get well are two different things. Some people go to church to feel better but never get well. Some come to church for comfort and leave unchanged. And that is what sin represents. ..it is a place to be comfortable thereby feeling normal in your own disfunction.


Stop praying to God to change your marriage or your finances because you might end up seeing that you are the one that need the change not your marriage or finances.


If you ask me I think the greatest breakthrough each and everyone of us need is not on finance, marriage, work, relationship, own house, car but self. The first breakthrough should start from being selfish.


Love, inspirational, life, humor, philosophy, truth, wisdom, happiness, god, hope, romance, death, inspirational-quotes, quotes, faith, poetry,writing, inspiration, knowledge

It is weird to me on how people will come to church frequently and have absolutely no desire or intention to change anything about their life based on what they experienced in the church.


Have you ever make out time to ask God if there is anything or anybody you need to drop in your life? Are you still holding on to offences? When is the right time to drop it?

Offence is an event, offended is a decision. Offence and offended we have to live through it but to stay offended? To live in that place denies the very nature of the salvation that you claimed to have received.


The forgiveness of God flows through me and because I am forgiven, I can forgive.


Being married or being in a close relationship is not based on how quickly you can get offended but on how you are ready to drop the offences, get over it and move ahead.


Before Marriage opposite attracts, after marriage opposite attacks. Just telling you the truth.


Is it not funny, in the presence of an unlimited God, we will still be stucked? Sometimes faith overwrites the fact, that some people have not come to realise. Stop giving excuses and telling God what is happening around you. You have the tools.


The closer the relationship, the greater the opportunities for intimacy. However the greater the opportunity the closer to offence. (A bit deep). Nobody can really make you mad more than someone that you really love. Nobody can hurt you like the somebody you have given your heart to.


The enemies agenda is destruction, his strategy is division and his tactics is on little differences. Mind you he is not going to be happy until he sees you divided.


What starts in the heart doesn't stay in the heart, it either turn into action or words.


Long before something happens in our life, it happened in our heart.


Freedom comes from focus, focus brings freedom. Focus on fear you will always be in prison, focus on faith and is nothing the world can keep you knocked down.


If God can help us locate demands, He can also help us locate the leaks.


Dear Lord please show me what really matters so that I may be able to determine what is distraction and God's direction in my life.


If I should be available to everyone, I will eventually end up with nothing to give to anyone. So the greatest gift you can receive from me is my time. Count yourself lucky if I give you a minute of my hour.


God's voice will be heard in the cave but only His visions will be revealed to you on the mountain. (A bit deep). God will always love you and will always speak to you but when you lose your perspective, you won't see his plan.


Could it be that while you are waiting for God to come down and help you, God is also waiting for you to get up? Maybe your breakthrough never happen when your situation changes but when you make a determination within yourself without excuses or blaming anybody and not waiting for anyone and stop praying that your situation change but let God change you. Let your prayer be God change me, God work in me, spring out the rivers of living water within me and I bet you, this is where the breakthrough begins.

We always think that God's presence is always provided to fix our problems but what if God's presence is more about fixing your perspectives? So that you will have a new way to see your problems. If you didn't make your bed before leaving home this morning, no angel is going to make your bed for you, it is still going to be as you left it till you come back.


Real faith looks beneath the surface. Real faith knows that faith works sometimes in dark places. Real faith knows that sometimes in order to see a change, you will have to steer through your situation to really see it.


God's perspectives requires persistence. To have God's perspective in the world we live in requires persistence.


If you work by faith and not by sight, you will always see a sign. You have to develop a space of comfort to know that there is a difference between signs and sounds, it means God will tell you that He will make a change in your life but He won't show you anything to demonstrate the change for a little while because He doesn't want your faith to be in the change; He wants your faith to be in the promise, so that when the change is a bit slow in coming, you will know how to trust in Him while you wait for it to come to pass.


I wrote a holy book as a fun way to test if I could and see if people could believe in it, before long people told me they were seeing visions of the gods and afterlife I had described. People had really strong faith in the scriptures I had written. Of course I insisted they were inspired. And they believed it. You can't imagine how gullible people can be


The open door is never behind you; the open door is always before you. Quit looking at your past life and mistakes. Look unto Jesus who is the Author and Perfector of our faith. Your open door is not in the opportunity you missed ten years ago, it is not in some stuffs behind you that you can't get back. You can't gain your access by giving attention to your past life.

What you see and what you listen to will determine how high you will go.


Most people are not so stupid to be not able to differentiate eventually between the right and the wrong individual , but it is only the foolish person who continues to misguide oneself solely as if s/he has not been caught as who s/he is as true character.


There is a throne up there and someone is sitting on it. It is not you, the economy or your government. My God is still on the throne and I shall not worry.


Take pride in failing ..at least you tried,

A person with his good writing can make some earning, but if he seems to be enjoying luxury living then probably it's time for all to see the intention of the people behind his promotion.


Dangerous dreams are daydreaming.


You'll change into what you were destined to be, when the world comes to end for you.


All religions are revealed and inspired. After all nothing happens without the will of god.


We come from different countries..different religions,

This life belongs to you dear,

Street change, I didn't


Anyone can write a holy book, if he feels god is calling him to do so


You can't love me if you don't love you, you can't think of nothing to do with me if you can't think of nothing to do with yourself, stop feeling sorry for yourself and tidy up, clean up the apartment until you get a house, do that job until you build your own company. Look at what you have and think on how to make it better.


Polish yourself everyday,

My faith gives me the ability to say, whatever is next, I'm ready. If it is Hillary or Trump I am ready because they might sit on the desk but they do not sit on the throne.


You don't have to feel grateful in order to be grateful.


The size of a plane does not change the weather but it will get you above it. The size of your faith may not change your situation but it will get you over it.


I didn't get to God by effort or title, I got there by invitation. God can lift you quickly if you let Him. He really cares.


We are beings of immense potential, ability and skills. In order to realize our God given talents we need to break through the fear barrier, which through its invisible walls traps us better than any physical prison can be constructed by the hands of man. Our human will and faith can break any barriers that fear can construct.


If you keep doing things that don't matter to you, you will not have time to do things that really do.


There is no where that life problem can take you that God's presence cannot reach you. There is nothing that people can do to you that can keep God from getting to you.


If negative emotions have gain access into your heart, it is because you have given it attention. If memories of pain and hurt dominates your heart, it is because you gave them attention. How can a memory hurt you when it has only happened? It can only hurt you when you give it attention.


You have a standing invitation to experience God's presence but you have to pay attention because attention creates access.


The reason some people do not experience God in their life is the same reason that we do not notice that something is going wrong with our marriage untill we arrive in a divorce court or that something is wrong with our child until we got a phone call from the police station . Simply put....Because we do not pay attention


When I call on God, I am not trying to get his attention and I am not trying to get Him to notice me. In all this my journey with Him two questions usually comes to my mind, they are; am I paying attention to him or am I trying to get his attention?


Sometimes we are asking God to reveal his presence, provisions and purpose in our lives and we pray like we are trying to get God's attention but I think prayer has less with getting God's attention but He getting mine.


Evil is real but God is greater.


God always have a perfect way for every imperfect situations.


An inspired stroke of a pen can save or damn the world


Great story tellers are great liars. None of those complex characters, events and settings are anything but the figments of their own imaginations


Your image is your brand and you have only one opportunity to make that first impression. Choose to make a positive first impression.


This is only rock bottom if you let it be.


Jag har inget emot att dö, bara inte i morgon, jag har en del jag skall göra först.


Allt stort som skedde i världen skedde först i någon människas fantasi.


A writer is a thought smith; he educates men to think for themselves


You never know what you are going to write until you start writing


Look at the words carefully; in them is hidden the mind of the writer


I see people around me following others,

Life & Death are beyond our control. We can't control where, how, or when we are born & we can't control where, how, or when we may die. Then why Worry about it.


Go..get up..start again my mind screams!

I am what I have ever read


I am not a supporter of burning books; but like poison, some books should be kept away from simple minds who can't take in the strong content they provide


There are waves drying to drown you down,

Your heart can see danger which your eyes can't see,

Your heart can see danger which your eyes can't see,

The Key to Happiness is to be FREE to BE what you want to BE!


The world would have been a better place if some men had just shut their mouths.


I live nearby a graveyard, that's where I get all my inspiration for wisdom and life


Find peace within yourself they said centuries ago,

You are almost done..the end is coming closer,

Don't let life make you bitter.


Beauty is not defined by your physical features. It is defined by the heart inside your chest and the love that flows through it.


Capture my heart and my mind. Become my ultimate challenge, greatest vexation, strongest desire, and most precious blessing.


I always look towards the light of my desires, so I never forget where I'm going.


When we release all the negativity in our lives and notice the beauty all around us, we'll see what truly matters in life.


Those of us who have already chosen to embrace a love ethic, know that when we let our light shine, we draw to us and are drawn to other bearers of light. We are not alone.


Even if I don't have wings to fly, I'll close my eyes and open my heart; then I'll make love my wings and hope the winds that give me flight.


I stand here alone- to shake off the blue


Every successful writer is bleeding somewhere, has a thorn in his flesh or suffers from some delusion. The most successful are the most suffering


Some writers dug their graves with their own pens


. If you want to write, just write anything that comes into your mind. You will be surprised at how you can force inspiration to stand on your side.


Stop worrying about what you cannot control. It's a total waste of your energy, energy that could otherwise be used to help you focus on what you can influence. I spend large parts of my coaching sessions helping people to sift through their challenges and concerns – helping them to determine what they can change and what they have no control over.


A writer is never alone, he is always with himself


When we write, we pour ourselves on the page. It's hard for an author to hide himself


You can edit what you write. Why not edit what you say? If it hurts somebody, you can still offer an apology or withdraw your statements


Live before the Journey is over, Live before it is too late. LIVE because you deserve to.


You cannot write if you are not on fire


Losing is better than backing out,

You cannot write if you are not angry


How do you feel when you read stuff written by dead authors? A visit by a ghost?


You never know what you will write until you write it


You say you have nothing to write about? How do you find things to talk about? You can write about those things you like to talk about, that's your area of expertise


Words disappear in the air, but writing remains. If you want something to be remembered about you, write it down


Able writers let us into their minds and show us how they think and by that open our minds to ourselves


Self-censorship is more efficient than any police. You write and say not what you really think, but what you believe is acceptable. By that process we lose those revolutionary ideas that could change society for the better


We write, not because we claim to know more than others, but perhaps because we want to know more than others. Writers are explorers


What if a man could write everything that came into his mind. You could find there gems of wisdom, depth of utter despair, heights of the most cherished hopes, killing fields where we slaughter our enemies, moments of faith and moments of doubts, dark chambers where we commit infidelity against our partners, counting the goods we have stolen, hell nightmares, heaven blessedness, cursing of our enemies and blessing of our friends, and many other things. If one could write his mind, it would be a mirror to other minds where they could find themselves and not feel as the only wretched souls in existence. Go on then, write your mind in a book and publish it


Write it as you see in your own perspective, you may be right or wrong but then what, that's how you see it


Sometimes I have a good idea, something I wish I could remember, and instead of writing it down, commit it to my memory only to disappear when I needed it. Write your ideas as they come, if you wait it will be too long and you may not recover it. It may get destroyed as it is to seed to and fro in the ever rushing river of our thoughts


If you are afraid of the critics you will never write a word


When I write sometimes I strike gold, sometimes I labor in vain and keep producing rubbish


The internet is killing the art of writing. The big publish button begs you to publish even before you go back and make one single edit, and as if this was not enough, you have instant readers who praise your writing skills!-


Dream..

Never let the light in your eyes

The secret to your success lies in surrounding yourself with sustainable love, and that starts with loving yourself. This is your hardest challenge. Through hundreds of hours spent coaching I have observed a common pattern – we can easily express our love for other people, possessions or experiences but find it difficult to say we love ourselves.


Knowing what's ETERNAL will sustain you through the EPHEMERAL.


A day in a man's life is constructed according to whether he accepts or rejects flashes of inspiration.


Every moment of Life is a Challenge to Choose. Some Win, some Lose.


Maybe there is an invisible world working behind our own, maybe words in the silence, maybe movements in what looks completely still. When every door is closed, maybe doors are opening that can't be seen.


Some people need a super hero to save them, but I am my own super hero. All I need is myself, my strengths and the fiery passions in my heart to overcome the obstacles in my life.


Writing is sharing. You share what you have. Great writers have more to share


The most powerful way of being able to listen to your own intuition is by being silent. Find a quiet space, slow down and calm your mind. Your goal is to eliminate all that noise going through your head – all those thoughts that appear from nowhere.


I used to be afraid about what people might say or think after reading what I had written. I am not afraid anymore, because when I write, I am not trying to prove anything to anyone, I am just expressing myself and my opinions. It's ok if my opinions are different from those of the reader, each of us can have his own opinions. So writing is like talking, if you are afraid of writing, you may end up being afraid of talking


Mystery is what makes women, woman. A woman without mystery is no woman. She is a girl who has yet discovered the depths of her heart.


The heart is a rare, unique treasure because it is strong and vulnerable at the same time. It is strong in its persistence to sustain life, yet it is vulnerable to both emotional and physical wounds.


It's why a song such as John Lennon's Imagine continues to resonateit's lovely to daydream about a world no longer plagued by the threat of famine, violence, war, or death. As long as these visions exist as a distant utopian fantasy, a counterbalance to a good zombie yarn, they don't threaten usbut neither do they really inspire us.


Everyday there will be an opportunity to Frown or to Smile, to Drown or to Dance, to be Sad or to be Glad. It's a Choice!


None of us are having a war with the world,

The power of a writer is that he is a god of sorts. He can create his own worlds and populate them with his own people, all by the powers of his imagination. It's the closest a man can come close to the gods. No wonder the most successful writers are considered immortals


Many writers write because they've been there, seen that, did it and burnt their fingers


One author said I write because I want to live a footprint in the sands of history. It's hard to live a footprint in the sands of history when giants are passing through the same sands unless you are one of the giants


A writer reports on the universe. When he presents his credentials, the gates of heaven and hell are equally opened to him. He can hear the devil's defense and god's accusations. The guards at the king's heart let him in. The writer can be anything and any one he wants. When he writes he is a god, he creates.


If I can write, who possibly can't. Even drawing a line in the sand is writing


No matter what happens in your life, keep an open heart and mind with a gentle smile. It's the true beauty of the heart.


Don't believe in everything that is written. Not everything that is written is true


The power of the writer is to capture the thoughts live and present them as they appeared in his mind


A writer is never alone; he is always in conversation with himself


Writing is self-pleasure


In order to protect their good names for posterity, many writers never wrote what they thought or the truth as it stood. That's why truth still lies hidden in matters of power, sex and religion. No wonder they chose to do so, many who dared paid with their heads


Writing is all about self-expression, we want to speak up, to get it off our chest. Whether we make an impact or not that is not for us to decide


If I had time, money and knowledge I could write about everything; but no problem, Google is already doing it


The level of sacrifice that a vision requires will determine the size of people who follow such leader.


Writing is magic happening on paper


If you are writing fiction, think like a god. Release all the power of your imagination; create worlds and destroy them at your will, create as many miracles as your story needs


People speak even after their death. Only do speak those who have recorded their speech in writing before they die, the rest go silent forever


Every book is worth reading. If it cannot make you wiser it will make you a critic


Today almost everybody is a writer, the enormous publish button on blogs and websites begs you everywhere to click on it! And bam you are a writer. To hell with agents and publishing houses and rejection letters. Immortality for you is on the click of a mouth! We are advancing at the speed of light! You can become an author at 140 characters. To hell with long winding sentences and long hours of scratching the head, the immortals of today instantly get a like and they instantly enter the pantheon! They seat side by side Plato, Socrates, Aristotle, St Paul, Buddha, Martin Luther, Rousseau, Bangambiki...


Today, do what you talked about doing yesterday.


We have to do what is right, not what is easy nor what is popular.


World needs positive energy. Put your happy energy into the universe.


We love being mentally strong, but we hate situations that allow us to put our mental strength to good use.


I'm not everything I want to be, but I'm more than I was, and I'm still learning.


Everything changed when I learned to honour my body instead of fighting it. When I learned to take care of it, like a precious castle to protect this weary heart. To stop harming it, punishing it for looking like this or that, feeling like this or that. I don't look like they all told me I had to do, but I'm healthy and strong and vital. That is enough.


Embrace the creativity and don't care about the result. It's better to be a beginner till the end of the life than waiting forever to be perfect.


There is a devil within all of us,

It's okay if you don't wish to follow the crowd,

Success is not forever and failure isn't fatal.


Don't judge me ..you have no idea how many obstacles I have faced,

The root of failure is self-pity. It leads to assumption that our needs are not being met now and probably never will be.


All human wisdom is contained in these two words - Wait and Hope.


Your mind is such a crucial asset to a victorious life. The mind is the eye of a man. What it sees and accepts shapes a man's life and determines his destiny.


Information transforms and command the keys to uncommon destiny in life.

First, know where you want to go. Then, go where you want to go. You are your own pilot and you can choose your Destination.


There is no rewind button in life,

Our science is a drop, our ignorance a sea.

Primo, si deve ricordare che il vostro sogno può essere realizzato con o senza che qualcuno di aiuto.

I dream it shatters, I expect and dissapoints, I get tired & Same dream insists I want to be your & my fatigue smiles as whole energy be in me .


My dreams are a little too big for me now, but I'll grow into them.


My heart is on the brink of a world so foreign that it feels like a fantasy. Blessed do I feel when I think of your heart which is so warm that it melts the frozen world we live in. Blessed I am with all of you that I hold near and dear to my heart.


For every summer & every summer after.

I used to worry about my Fears, but I realized that most of the time nothing bad happened. So, I have stopped worrying.


Love should make you better not bitter.


He never walks alone..His hopes accompany him everywhere.. everyday,

Dare to be different. The world is full of the ordinary.


Passion is the fuel that drives ordinary people to achieve extraordinary results by aligning their hearts, minds, beliefs and efforts.


حين نعرف عيوبنا، وحين نخرج إلى العالم لا نحتاج إلى من يذكّرنا بها لأجل الإنتقاد ولأجل الضحك


You have energy but you don't work..whose mistake?

People do not often respond to a person who is consistently true to his words and deeds, but the mother nature will definitely reply to him in its language.


Project a confident image through good body posture.


Y'know, when I first started listening to punk rock music, I used to get my fucking ass kicked for it! I was known as a fucking freak! But now I'm amongst many many many freaks here with me tonight!

Ladies, if someone touches you and you don't want them to, feel free to punch them in the fucking face!


Where are You Now? I was there whilst you cried,

Your tears are diamonds dear,

Honoring your values is an act of self-love and self-care.

It is much wiser to express wisdom more in deeds than in words.


Work neither for fame nor profit. An artist should aspire only to inspire.


The integrity of the upright provides guiding principles that help him to achieve his vision. Hard work without integrity will lead to struggles and frustration


Integrity is the ability of being honest and having strong moral principles and values, which reflect in our character.

A person who is too goody-goody only in own words with most of the people and most of the time is most likely to be not a trustworthy buddy.


If you won't push someone up, the least you can do is not to pull him down.


Trust your own shadow,

No wrong in aiming or applauding the win but always agnize one's efforts.


If it is meant to happen it will happen,

We just held each other for warmth. I cannot recall that we even spoke to one another. Such was our shock. That day we learnt a new wordwar.


It seemed that balance was necessary. The old and the new needed to be combined, the traditions adapted. That was the way forward. Without balance change could not occur.


It doesn't cost much to be Happy if the currency of your heart is the blowing of the breeze and the swaying of the trees.


I CAN DIE FOR YOU ...yes you can,

The fact of your heart's enfoldment in mine is evidence enough that there is, underneath it all, some hidden order to this world.


Stand tall and be proud. Realize confidence is charismatic and something that is something money can't buy, it radiates from within you.


Honor those who inspire you, who show you the way. The teachers, artists , writers, the healers. Respect their time, their intellectual properties, their fee. They live a life of service, but this is also the way they make their living. This is how they feed, clothe and shelter themselves and their families. This is how they can continue to do their work in the world.


Life is full of challenges, seen and unseen, so to look and feel great, you must hold your head up each day and project your inner confidence.


For some people I was an inspiration.

I treat my writing life like a fabulous, enchanting lover, because that is what it is to me. Something that is terribly time consuming, delicious and time-stopping. I have missed important meetings for love, and I will continue to put my writing life in the same position. My writing life is the lover at the center, not the neglected cranky demanding millstone, my ball and chain.

I have missed important meetings for love, and I will continue to put my writing life in the same position. My writing life is the lover at the center, not the neglected cranky demanding millstone, my ball and chain.

Above all, protect your inner light. There are those that seek to take it from you.


Do you want to make your Life exciting? Then find a purpose that will make you jump out of bed each day with Enthusiasm, Power and Excitement.


Chaos is nothing more than beauty about to dance.


Life can be a real bitch at times and force us to destroy what we created. The important thing is to believe in what we created, to believe in the magic of the moment when we found those people in our lives, keep fighting until life bows down to our wishes and lets them be a part of our existence.


What happens to the space that two people occupied together? How can it just disappear? Why can't it just become something else?


I'm not an insomniac. It's just that my mind is in the best position to catch the weight of all hovering possibilities the moment I lie down.


Products come with a WARNING label that reveals what they are made of. People come with one too; it is found in their actions.


The face of God shines as a light on our path


Guys are busy making major moves while we are sleeping.


It is true that everyone has Problems, and it is also true that every problem has a Solution. If this is the reality of Life, then why not focus on solutions rather than Problems.

The only loss is death.


If you celebrate Independence Day on just one day of the year, it only goes on to show that you are not truly Free.... Learn to celebrate your Freedom every day!


A fiery spirit bursts from your soul.


Life is made up of Moments. Moments create Days, days create Months, months create Years, years create LIFE. Lose the Moment and you lose Life.

It's great to earn, but don't leave it behind for someone else to burn.



The word Wisdom was for the people who have high level of inferiority complex and who are battling with some hard times.


If the past was what we were meant to see...then behind, not in front, our eyes would be.


Why wish for something that will never be? It ends in nothing but heartbreak. We wish, then we think about how things would be if our wishes came true. And we feel happy thinking about those things. But then we wake up and realise that our wishes don't have wings. And it hurts because all the happiness that we thought of, was never real. Hold on to what you have, try to find your happiness in what is, rather than what should or could have been.


Selfishness and foolishness go hand in hand ; and its quantity in a person's life only decides as what quality of people s/he has as her/his friend.


You're hard sometimes, but you're genuine and easy to love.  You give people everything you have to give, Silas.  You're a rough diamond amongst pearls.  You look like a dirty stone amongst the sheen, but your value far exceeds the silky dull shine of a pearl.


How can you get what you want if you do not know what you are seeking?


It is GOOD to cherish your yesterdays; It is BETTER to dream your tomorrows; but it is BEST to live your today's! Remember to hold fast to your dreams, for if your dreams die, then your life is like a bird with broken wings that cannot fly.


A confident soul is un-conquerable spirit.


When you are living your life according to your values, you are being true to yourself and others. There is congruence between what you think, what you say, and what you do.


I create beautiful art, so I can look back on the life my body fell short of in such a way that it brings me peace.


Life is like a piano. White keys are happy moments and the black ones are sad moments. Both keys are played together to give us the sweet music called Life.


You should be more careful

Those who win never quit.

For each new morning let there be flow of love. Let there be light of happiness in every direction.


No matter where we come from, there is one language we can all speak and understand from birth, the language of the heart, love.


Those who win never give up; those who give up never win.


But not just alive like I was yesterday and the day before. Alive like I knew I was alive. Like I could feel the breaths coming into my chest. And I knew I was the person inside my own body.


My BODY isn't flawed, your thinking is. #UniquelyMe


Success is a process, not an event.


To the extent you expand your consciousness is the extent to which you experience being divine.

The only thing that makes advice great is when you apply it and it works so try, try try.

Our mind can move directly and aggressively on impulse, while our spirit moves gently and calmly on our intuition.


When we start focusing our energy on the things we love, they come easier and more effortlessly over time.


Look at the people around you. Some Inspire you, some Perspire you. Be with those that build Energy in you.


What is your motivation? When you drill down and ask, What if there was zero ROI (of any form)?, you'll discover your highest and best use of time.


What many people do not understand is: It's not about who you think you know, but about who actually knows you. So better start giving today, be it giving everything at your job, or giving out lunch to that man. Start giving, and the world will know your true character!


There is nobody else on earth like you and me. Let us be who we are meant to be.

Your hopes and dreams are like a giant helium balloon, tugging on your hand to take you above the clouds, to that quiet place of peace and contentment. All you have to do is stop resisting, to let go - and ALLOW your hopes and dreams to take you there.


I have occupied this idle, empty winter with writing a story. It has been written to please myself, without thought of my own vanity or modesty, without regard for other people's feelings, without considering whether I shock or hurt the living, without scrupling to speak of the dead.

The real winners I've met in life weren't necessarily skilled or perfect. They just had the tenacity to never, ever give up.


Love is our religion. Love is our light. It is the only thing that gives us any hope.


Sky is not the limit if your heart is in it, for when you do something with all your heart, it just happens.


Whatever you struggle with is an indication there is key information you haven't accessed yet.


He had always wanted to write music, and he could give no other identity to the thing he sought. If you want to know what it is, he told himself, listen to the first phrases of Tchaikovsky's First Concerto - or the last movement of Rachmaninoff's Second. Men have not found the words for it nor the deed nor the thought, but they have found the music. Let me see the answer to the promise of that music. Let me see it made real. Let me see the answer to the promise of that music. Not servants nor those served; not altars and immolations; but the final, the fulfilled, innocent of pain. Don't help me or serve me, but let me see it once, because I need it. Don't work for my happiness, my brothers --- show me yours --- show me that it is possible --- show me your achievements --- and the knowledge will give me courage for mine.


Not truly living in the present moment & later regretting is like closing your eyes when a peacock is dancing, only to want to see it dance once it is gone.


Your attention is so sacred that if you truly look for beauty and grace, you will find it in everything.


Destiny and efforts both go hand in hand.


Most people lose the only thing they possessLifewhile acquiring the many things that will finally never be theirs.


Maybe we feel empty because we spend so much of our own time watching other people live their lives, chase their dreams, express their love, and navigate their relationships. And when we turn off our TV or put down our phone... We've nourished nothing of our own.


God has provided food for every bird, but He doesn't throw it in their nests


Flow with the go! If you want to experience the magnificence of the Universe in your life accept where you are, own it, take responsibility for it.

Humor, motivations, moral,gods,energy,secrecy


Life is not just to run and run, it is also not just to have fun. Life is complete when we get something worthwhile done.


We can all be clockmakers, or astronomers. But if we all wanted to be Pushkin. . .if the question is, how do you make a poem by Pushkin?- or, what exactly makes one poem or painting or piece of music greater than another?- or, what is beauty?, or liberty?, or virtue?- if the question is, how should we live?. . . then, reason gives no answer or different answers. So something went wrong. The divine spark in man is not reason after all, but something else, some kind of intuition or vision, perhaps like the moment of inspiration experienced by the artist . . .


Some days I feel more like a scribe than a creator. I will have the major points fleshed out, but there is always a turn or two that I didn't see coming, or which came earlier than I expected it to, or not at all...


You can Live in your Cave OR Dance to your Grave.

The purpose of life is to live for others. The moment you start living for yourself, you die before you time.


You may kill a fire. And everything you know falls to dust and ash. Yet the remarkable treasure in this seemingly hopeless pile, is hidden deep within. The burning embers incarnate the perpetual desire to go from spark to flame.


There are people who are dancing through Life and others who are crying through Life. The irony is that Life is the samewhat we do is purely our Choice.


Love can bless you with a sense of purpose and direction when all else fails. Because to have faith in love is to be optimistic about life. Love is hopefulness.


Death, like so much in life, is a lesson, which must be understood and cherished, not feared; it is a rite of passage we all must encounter at one time or another; it helps build our character and makes us stronger if we can endure its painful aftermath.


Grab every chance given and do not throw it away; always cherish what you already have, for you never know when you will receive something of its likeness again; and if you lose what was most precious to you, never stop fighting for it until you have it once again in your possession.


Your love opened up a whole world that no amount of books or wisdom could ever do.


My strength is my pride. My pride is my heart. And my heart will always be mine and mine alone.


We shouldn't live in a world where we live in constant terror. We need less dying and more living. We need less destroying and more building. We need less hate and more love.


Our past is what molds us into the person we are today. It does not define us.


Name and form are simply illusions of separation. Love doesn't make us blind; rather, it erases the illusions so we can see clearly.


Dreams are like puzzles. When all the pieces are missing, it is up to us to find them and decide where and how they fit in.


Here's another poem,

It is raining blood today.

Sometimes we need to just brush away our pride, break down the walls around our hearts, and open up to those we truly care for.


Few of us have reached such impasses to claim ourselves to be almighty; as of yet I am not one of the few. Knowing this though sets me apart from the two sides of the many.


To love is to finally live.


Beauty is great... But love is greater. With it, you can overcome anything fate throws at you.


There is nothing to fear. There is no such thing as death. Death has nothing to do with us. But you said something about being talented--- that it makes one different. Now, that does have something to do with us. And talent in the highest and broadest sense means talent for life.


Two things are needed to raise awareness: education and love. And these go hand in hand because we can be taught to love.


To know the truth of one's heart, trusting their words is not always the wisest thing because words can be used to deceive you. To truly know the truth which lies deep in one's heart, you only have to look into their eyes. For even though the mouth may speak lies to hide the truth, the eyes will always reveal what the mouth tries to hide.


We always want to hold on tight to those we love; but if we intend to keep those we love, we must let go every once in awhile.


We all have the ability to make someone's life better with our love.


No one is born with Positive Passion. This Power is ignited by Inspiration!


The Richest person is not the Happiest person, the Happiest person is the Richest person.

What we believe is a matter of choice provided we have control over our thoughts. It's no less than living in bliss with each passing moment when you can see your thoughts flowing in apt directions.

Today's happiness depends on yesterday's choice, just as today's choice will determine tomorrow's happiness.


Love is the most integral function of our lives. That is why LOVE is only one letter away from LIVE.


When you begin to do what matters most to you, you let go of preconceived notions of who you are which have been fostered by others and start creating the person you most want to be.


To overcome the sadness of our hearts, we must remember the joys of our lives.


No, I won't be hopeless. I am full of hope. I'm a HopeFUL. ~ Evie Snow


Great growth comes from loneliness. You have time to develop, dwell in your own mind and go a bit mad. All great people are a bit mad. That's good to remember. Don't escape it. 

Don't try to worry about the things that could've happen. Just wonder about the things that can still happen and fight for them. Because anything worth fighting for will happen in time.


Leave mystery in your life. Give them a little and keep them wondering. If you reveal everything about yourself, people will lose interest. For as humans, we are curious creatures. We are more interested in the things lurking in the shadows than the things that are brought into the light.


There is so much power in choosing to love yourself against all odds and I hope with every kind of painful experience you become more aware who you are and what you are truly capable of. Life hurts but it's also remarkabley beautiful if you look past the chaos.


Hidup ini adalah perjalanan panjang. Kumpulan dari hari-hari. Di salah satu hari itu, di hari yang sangat spesial, kita dilahirkan. Kita menangis kencang saat menghirup udara pertama kali. Di salah satu hari lainnya, kita belajar tengkurap, belajar merangkak, untuk kemudian berjalan. Di salah satu hari berikutnya kita bisa mengendarai sepeda, masuk sekolah pertama kali, semua serba pertama kali. Dan kini kita penuh dengan kenangan masa kecil yang indah, seperti matahari terbit.

When people tell you that you aren't something or you can't accomplish your dreams, you can either cry about it or prove them wrong.


Sometimes you just have to find the majesty in yourself and other things to truly appreciate life.


Love, it is timeless. It can transcend the very limits of time and space, as long as it stays forever true in our hearts.


We need to find the light within ourselves, so we can see our true worth.


Let your innocence show as brilliant as your dreams because only then can you discover the true beauty of love.


People always talk. Dont stress youself what people say. Just live your life they way you know how.


If it is unappetizing: Do not eat, date, or sign up for it. If the mere thought of it is depressing: Do not major in it, sit through it, or devote your life to it. If it is not important to you: Do not do it only because it is important to someone else. You will thank yourself


Most diseases are caused not so much by what we eat, but more by what is eating us.

Love awakens the soul.


Sometimes wisdom dictates that you take a few steps backwards to be able to go much further


Being honest it doesnt mean you are always doing the right thing. It means you are truethful. In doing that you are getting more respect and being respected for the trueth you say nomatter what you did or worse is the damage. You will also be trusted in many things.


Every year it minus or subtract a percentage of your life. Thats why when we grow , The time is more faster, the months are faster, days are faster. We are hardly able to keep track of time. We are also getting closer to death than we were .


I am forever busy working, because I want to work until get a personal call from the bank. Telling me that they cant add more zeros in my account. The number is too long , that they have rounded it off, but still cant add more digits to it.


When asked what gift he wanted for his birthday, the yogi replied: I wish no gifts, only presence.


If you compromise your core values, you go nowhere.

Our hearts may be strong and resilient against the trials of life, but they become weak and fragile against the trials of love.

Take a look at the plants. They come together and thrive peacefully in the garden or park. They lean on each other without trying to outdo one another. They serve as a sign that we can see beyond our differences and embrace each other in love while allowing our uniqueness to add color to our world. If plants can live in harmony and show their beauty to the world, we as humans can do much more.


I would rather try and fail at something than not try at all. Because if I don't try to do something, I will be filled with wonder on whether or not I could've succeeded, and not soon after that wonder will turn to regret. I refuse to live my life wondering and regretting what could've been. I want to live my life with the satisfaction of knowing I tried no matter if I succeed or fail.


There is no better remedy for disorder than to let it run its course; it will then disappear on its own.


I'm not here for the money; I'm here for the souls.

A person gets the people around oneself not by own desire or wish, but as who s/he character-wise is. That's perhaps the first cardinal rule of Karma.


My day begins at dawn as I take my cup of strong black espresso outside to watch the sunrise. I learned this ritual from my mother, who worked in a bread shop. Bakers are the great philosophers of the world, mostly because they have to get up early. When the world is quiet, great art is created - or, at the very least, conceptualized. Now is the moment to sketch, make notes, and dream.


Go in wisdom until we dance once again among the stars.


When we observe oppression, let us develop strategies that free not only the oppressed but also the oppressor. Let us remember that those who use their power to deny freedom to others are also imprisoned and are also worthy of care. Do not let their unjust actions inspire us to cruelty, or else we will soon become what we set out against.

A rainbow in the sky or a bird that can fly often create Joy that money can't buy!


Any kid will tell you that, yes, their music is both an escape and a survival mechanism, and that sometimes the music givesbthem hope and inspiration. It doesn't just placate and pacify.

Don't think about the writing process too much. Just do one thing: tell the motherfucking story.


Stop writing caption. Go action!


I know a woman who gets tattoos all the time. She acquires new tattoos the way I might buy a new pair of earrings. She wakes up in the morning and announces, I think I'll go get a new tattoo today. If you ask her what kind of tattoo she's planning on getting, she'll say casually, I dunno....I'll figure it out when I get to the tattoo shop. Or I'll just let the artist surprise me.

My ability is greater than my disability.


I wondered what a man I had encountered the day before on the plane en route to Chicago's O'Hare airport would have made of this. As he tried to push through a crowded aisle, he said loudly: Life is never easy. And it's never pleasant. I couldn't let this go. I looked up at him from my seat and said, I do hope life gives you cause to change that opinion. Otherwise you may find that opinion walking ahead of you, giving you more and more reasons to believe it.


Come into my world.

Le telefonate che si ricevono a quest'ora, pensava Tina trascinandosi dalla cucina al salotto per rispondere, si dividono sempre in due categorie.

Let us Build the Boat first to cross the River.


My places were emotional, primarily. I wrote of locales in which I had lived, or in which I imagined I could live, but the topography was primal and sexual and terminal. It bore no distinct architecture or design or dialect. It was merely human and in peril, which is to say universal. But on Royal and Coliseum and Vista--streets I cannot relinquish--I found my places and I dreamed a narrative. Can I go there and find it again?--Tennessee Williams

Look around you, Jayavar, she continued. See how the temple inspires? How the dreams of its makers can still be felt on this day? You must inspire our people just as our temples do, by convincing them that they're part of something far more beautiful and glorious than themselves.

Dans une vie de bohème

I do not much trust the man who cares solely to inspire - he does not really inspire me - only the man who cares mostly to tell the truth, whatever that may do. For when the man who cares to tell the truth happens to inspire, I, in addition, find it easier to believe that he in fact does his homework on how and when one should truly inspire.


Every living word that gives life was once without form.


A child develops best when, like a young plant, he is left undisturbed in the same soil. Too much travel, too much variety of impressions, are not good for the young, and cause them as they grow up to become incapable of enduring fruitful monotony.

Don't try to be something for everyone, just be everything for someone. Remain vulnerable.

Moments of suffering are meant to empty us so that we may have the potential to tap into our truest depths.


I write our names on the page.

Moving is not about forgetting. It's about moving forward and never looking back.


The best way to get through any challenge is to step back, look up at the sky, breathe deeply in and out, smile if you have to...then dive in.


However, one day, this shallow living will not be enough for you. You are gifted with a questioning mind that will marvel at the deepest parts of the world around you.

We were not sent into this world to do anything into which we cannot put our hearts.


Don't ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive.


Bravery is not the absence of fear, but rather, it is the decision to look fear in the eyes and press on regardless


If you think a weakness can be turned into a strength, I hate to tell you this, but that's another weakness.

When Passion meets Inspiration, an Obsession is born.


When I use people I know, all of my instincts seem to go dead, and if I'm getting anywhere near myself then I can't do it. It's actually a real weakness! I hate writing personal essays, I don't think I'm especially good at it. I like just encountering [my characters], discovering them. I love the escape of just being surrounded by all these people who are nothing like people I know. But I don't find it hard to be in the middle of a different life, with a different set of habits and way of thinking and talking. That seems to come easily to me.


But even a vessel pulsates, beats and pumps in ecstasy and in rage!

Your schedule predicts your miracle or not!


We all program our gadgetscomputers, mobiles, but we don't Program our Mind in such a way that we can REJOICE and BE HAPPY.


I let go of false hope. I let go of the hope that they would transform in favour of working on my own transformation. I let go of the hope that they would HEAR me. I let go of the hope that they would SEE me. Instead of my hope being in THEM, I listened to me. I heard me, I saw me, I validated my own pain and I began to emerge from the broken life I had been living.

There are so many things that we learn in our lives most of which we can't learn without seeing the hearts of others.


When we can see the star of desire in our sky, we can use our wings of hope and our air of love to reach it.


Living on Faith.

Don't try to reach perfection. Just try to reach an inner and outer realization of self.


Think not of the fragility of life, but of the power of books, when mere words have the ability to change our lives simply by being next to each other.


To dream is to desire, to desire is to long for, to long for is to want, and to want you must work to attain all you dream of, desire, long for and want.


I love being high. High on Life, High on Love, High on Hope, and High on Faith.


Love me, hate me, hurt me or kill me. I keep fighting.


Life is like Mother Nature - unpredictable. Friends /relatives who promise to help, will avoid you when you need them. Then, you struggle to get through and suddenly, some stranger walks in offering you the help you needed.

Think not of the fragility of life, but of the power of books, when mere words can change our lives simply by being next to each other.


I am a puzzle and a conundrum and a thunderstorm.

Don't wait for inspiration. It comes while working.


When you are in harmony with love and positivity, everything you want will be pushed in your direction and given to you.


Self-love is having appreciation for oneself, respecting oneself, and caring for oneself, and the actions that help us mature also help it grow.


Some people believe in the power of positive mind. I don't think that is right in essence. Positive mind is not something to believe on, it is something to live and count on. Work hard, believe in God, that is a sufficient positive mind, because the doctrines of God are all about living a life that counts:- working hard, success and achievement.


The most beautiful smile belongs to those who make others smile


The Wind that Blows, the Water that Flows, the Sun that Glows, are all proof that a Power exists. Believe and Experience the Universal Power.


The past ruins the present to destroy the future. Take charge of the NOW.

A mí me gustaría contribuir a la vida con algo de belleza (...)

Sometimes it seems like pain is too obvious a place to turn for inspiration. Pain isn't always deep, anyway. Sometimes it's awful and that's it. Or boring. Surely other things can be as profound as pain.


Even with all the Lace, you can't be an Ace without God's grace.- RVM


Many people get visited by the Lord in a given time but lack the wisdom to navigate in it.


Love is silent. Yet it could fill the spaces no other sound can ever do. Truth is there's no sound without silence. We can listen to all the beautiful songs, but unless we can hear where the music is coming from, the empty spaces of our lives can never be filled and the song we sing will have no meaning.


I am not here to be average, I am not here to be great, I am not here to be successful, and I am not here to be happy, I am here to simply be all of me.


To reach your Destination, you need a Direction, but you can't get there without Inspiration!- RVM


All the pain on the outside can not undo what is felt on the inside.

Classical music is the best, and cheapest, mind-altering drug in the world.


Sadness is an invitation to God.

Live your Dream


All kinds of people read poetry: revolutionaries, scholars, sentimentalists etc. But above all else, lovers read poetry. Why? Because we fell in love. And then we fell in love with love.


Don't let God be the co-author of your life.

You ain't get nothing for staying low, lazy. The world only tremble at the feet of the few craziest doers ever lived.


I firmly believe that life is made up of moments. Some are significant, and some are disposable. Some sit at the edge of your awareness and taunt you when you're trying to sleep, and others fade into the background noise of life. But every moment, no matter how small, has the potential to create or destroy you.


Funny thing about the darkness...

Don't let anything be too much for you

You can never truly fail, if you never stop trying.


Your mind, it will trick you

Close your eyes and trust; go in the direction of what makes you feel authentically lighter and brighter. There is no good or bad. Retribution feels vibrationally better than desperation. It's better than sitting still because your energy has movement. Frustration is better than retribution, because now you're not projecting negative energy outward, you're processing it within. Apathy is better than frustration; at least you've reached some form of detachment. Optimism is better than apathy. Optimism becomes happiness. Co-creative inspiration follows... and then comes joy.


So grateful for those who truly love me... they hear everything I don't say.


Here I stand now, with a sweet tingling feeling all over, recalling the last time I was here, and I am glad that I am here again, while wondering why I didn't recognize it earlier.

Make your book of life a musical. Never abandon obligations, but have fun leaving behind a colorful legacy. Never allow anybody to be the composer of your own destiny. Take control of your life, and don't allow limitations implanted by society tell you how your music is supposed to sound  or how your book is supposed to be written.

It is all about how you do things. You can cut the Apple with the knife and with the same knife you can kill somebody.


Everything around you that you call life was made up by people, and you can change it.


People are of two types of breed. One who is known for their good deeds & such folks' need is very high as they care; other who is known for their greed & such persons grow like weed everywhere.


When we are restless, it only implies that we are everywhere else but in the moment.


We free our own minds

Mindset Matters: Cut away the nonsense and cultivate an environment conducive to your personal well-being. Forgive yourself and others. Have the courage to move on. The battle is long... and in the end, it's only with yourself.


Do not feel sad for your tears as rocks never regret the waterfalls


Regardless the destination, all roads lead home.


Goodness is about character - integrity, honesty, kindness, generosity, moral courage, and the like. More than anything else, it is about how we treat other people.


For the novelist or poet, for the scientist or artist, the question is not

Crowns belong to those that serve.


True wealth comes less from having riches than from knowing how to live richly.


People should be always careful of two persons. One who is totally dedicated to his family especially his wife and others who are completely addicted to the women in life.


We must think of ourselves as a tribe  as an international community that has come together with a common purpose of being initiated into the process.

Even if a person unravels everything before everyone to say the real facts: 'This is This' & 'That is That', the probability is very high is that the majority of people may say 'This is That' & 'That is This'.


Don't wait too long. Life takes unexpected turns, and we don't always have the time we think we have.


Those who are critical of my goals and dreams simply do not understand the higher purpose to which I have been called.


Trust your instincts, follow your bliss, make plans, work hard, learn to let things go. Don't be late. Remember that fortune favors the brave. Live. If you need to run, try and run toward something.

Today, I will look around & enjoy all the beautiful things that are around me rather than yearn for things that are beyond my control & become miserable.-RVM


The first time I saw a mermaid in my dream, and she looked so real...THAT.'s fishy!!


I write. I imagine. The act of imagining in itself enlivens me. I invent characters. At times I feel as if I am digging up people from the ice in which reality enshrouded them. I write because I could not tell her that my life has fallen into categories. I write because I am no longer able to see the spark in her eyes! I write because she used to read my words but she is no longer by me to read! I admit, sometimes, I wish if I can sleep for the rest of the life! Does this really makes sense?


Dance less in motion and more in spirit; awaken the dreamer within.


You're going to make something wonderful of yourself. I promise.

Music does not need language of words for it has movements of dance to do its translation.


To one degree or another we all fight against preconceptions nearly every day. The wisest people I know don't compare their fight to that of others. Everything is relative through the lens of personal struggle.

The secret of making lasting change is to acknowledge and accept that real change takes time and patience. We didn't get chronically ill overnight. We didn't gain weight in one week or even one month. Good chance, it may take us longer than twenty-one days to overcome whatever we're facing. Whether it's something physical, emotional, spiritual, or a combination, we may need to be realistic in our goals for meaningful change to happen. The first step is getting started!

Dance resides within us all. Some find it when joy conquers sorrow, others express it through celebration of movements; and then there are those... whose existence is dance,


That was the day I made up my mind, I am the voice of those who don't have the strength to cry.


Soar like an eagle beyond skies of heavens reach; as wings of dreams dance with winds of reality.


World seems like a void of silence every time footsteps are deprived of dancing shoes.


The difference between fanfic and a real novel is that fanfic is honest about its inspiration.


Hearts shall dance once again; when canvas of ice is painted with the brush of skates.

Acceptance is a thing... look into it.

The more you know yourself, the less judgemental you become


The pain in a person's life is bound to rise on becoming increasingly wise as nice; for then s/he could easily recognize the truth and lies of the people, hanging around her/him, better than others.


You can't move things by not moving.


Wisdom stems from personal accountability. We all make mistakes; own them... learn from them. Don't throw away the lesson by blaming others.

when you become addict in to MATERIAL things in life then the TRUE natural life start to run away from you, YES! it's can give you certain pleasure in the society but in the same time it will sabotage your true HAPPINESS of life which we could have simply with GRATITUDE and FORGIVENESS


Why waste your strength envying and hating instead of loving?


I only wish to write.


Sometimes we just need to be heard... There are times in life when being heard leads to being healed.


Sometimes we need someone to just listen. Not to try and fix anything or offer alternatives, but to just be there... to listen. An ear that listens can be medicine to a heart that hurts.


In the process of looking at broken paths, we often forget the lights that illuminates that path.


Our choices today is our life tomorrow.


It is in the combination of words and visuals that the magic of understanding often happens.

Henry Luce to his Time magazine writers: Tell the history of our time through the people who make it.


I have faith in your eternal, comprehensive plan, and I believe that someday I will be able to see that you have made my life a beautiful tapestry. Right now I can see only sections of the back, with all of its knots and loose ends. But I trust that someday in heaven I will see the front in its entiretythe picture of world history and my own life from your perspective. How amazing that will be! So today give me the grace to interpret unexpected and even unwelcome circumstances as part of your grand plan. When I do, I know I'll be able to embrace both the good and the bad, knowing that you are weaving a beautiful picture with my life.


As much as Henry Kissinger wanted to attribute historical movement to impersonal forces, he too conceded to the difference personalities make.


The only thing that belongs to us is our LIFE. Yet, we waste it in the pursuit of meaningless things that will never belong to us.- RVM


The lack of forgiveness and ingratitude leads unhappiness


The longer the wondering, the longer the writing.


Ce qui m'inspire le plus. C'est l'amour, parce que je crois que l'amour c'est à la fois, la chose la plus recherchée et vraisemblablement, la chose la plus maltraitée.


Don't just follow the line. To be a star - SHINE! -RVM


There is nothing more fascinating than the fusion between power and mystery in our great, little treasure: the human brain.


You must be willing to play with Failure before you reach Success.-RVM


God's vessel

If you want to shine like a sun, first burn like a sun.


Sand lines my soul which is filled with the breath of the ocean.



Inspiration works on the same sense as humans, quite generous yet impatient. When it calls, better respond there and then or it moves shop.


Music is a writer's heartbeat.


A person ought to be always cautious of what s/he asks for from God because everyone has to invariably pay the price in proportion to the preciousness of the prize from HIM.


I always believed that first love would stay in my heart the longest, that it would be reminded through every man I met, through every song and every place I had been too, it hurt like hell to experience my heart crashing into a thousand pieces amongst the floor & the feeling of missing them so bad that my body ached that I spent a lot of time alone wondering if I deserved to be loved the way I love and then I met you & you gently reminded me that I was worthy and in your actions taught me to give love one more chance. So I did and as vulnerable and uncertain it all is, im glad my heart has met someone it wants to open for again.


The full length of a frog doesn't have to be seen when it's dead. It has to be seen when it jumps. Aim for greater heights always.


We encounter truth within.


That which is cool is driven by the soul.


Through me, I see you. Through you, I see me.


The marriage between potential and inspiration is pronounced by willingness. If one isn't there, then you will chase inspiration instead of it finding you.


Our peace is our purpose.


Inspiration shouldn't respond to time, rather the other way around. Time must be altered to inspiration, Timing is wrong NO! Timing is never wrong. Sacrifice and the likes gets thrown in at this point.


Don't be so busy making a living that you forget to enjoy your Life. Today, make a commitment to Enjoy Life.


It ain't so easy writing about nothin


You should be happy because I was certain (predictable) with u, rest of the world named me VOLCANO.

Failure for one is a source of creativity, build on it and a different story will puzzle itself.


Gratitude is the gateway to a positive life.


Be the consequence of finding inspiration not rent-a-storage for one.


Inspiration does not linger in one place over time, therefore human effort shouldn't be scaled on earlier attempt.


Jesus does not suffer so as to exclude your suffering. He bears a cross, not that you may escape it, but that you may endure it.


All uniquely defines itself.


You heard me cry long before I knew my voice.


The fountain of youth resides in our memory. You will never outlive your shadow.


Beauty is light set free.


Happiness is a shadow. If you chase it, it moves further away. But if you turn to make others happy, it will follow you. Make others Happy and be Happy.

People are like pistachios. Some of them open up easily, but there are others who need to be really broken to get into.- RVM


When you pursue your goals with passion, you will attract people who love you; but you'll also attract haters. I'm okay with that; I welcome it. I don't want to live life as a spectator. I've learned that if no one is cheering you on and/or booing you; it means you're not in the game.


I had to learn how to motivate myself and others; to give inspiration as well as keep pathways in my mind open so inspiration could find me.


Individuals often turn to poetry, not only to glean strength

Create. Not for the money. Not for the fame. Not for the recognition. But for the pure joy of creating something and sharing it.


To live 'forever', let your purpose in life be bigger than you.


The elegance under pressure is the result of fearlessness.


Ask of your eyes to see

Love is meant to be shared, and happy is the woman who'd willing to risk all for that.


So grateful for the people who heard me when I was silent and saw me when I was invisible.


Take Care of Yourself First- It's Easier to Serve Others That Way.


Life is Ambition, not for Survive but for Be Better each second, for Superate your Records and to Get your Goals.

Pretense has created so many good men.


Everywhere, I am welcome, I will stay there.


When efforts that are wisely executed, the situation and condition don't affect the performance.


Listen little Songkeeper, the voice whispered, and I will sing you a Song.


Life is way too short to get lost, so follow the script the way it comes and keep changing the checkpoints on every page.


I have come to the conclusion that there are three aspects of life that can give our existence the joy, purpose and meaning that we may seek.

What matters is not how many miles you run... What matters is whether you are having Fun! -RVM


Far greater than all the material possessions that I possess, is my Freedom to Choose, my Freedom to Live, and my Freedom to be Happy.- RVM


Be Grateful- Your Life is a Miracle.


One thing about pretence is that you may not know when you leave what you call the real you behind. Pretend to be happy now and see for yourself.


Be Generous with your Kindness, Compassion & Forgiveness.


Anyone can exist. Most fools do. It takes guts to truly Live. -RVM


Have a dream or vision? Keep striving toward it, never give up on it, pray about it and ask God to bless it. And no matter who doesn't believe or understand it, it's because it's not for them, it's for YOU.


Breathe Through the Pain, It Always Gets Easier with Time.


We are born into this precious human existence to achieve the uni cation of opposites and become enlightened, or liberated, from the illusion of separation.


Polarity exists so that we may discover the truth beyond this world of duality, which is the ultimate purpose of life.


Decide to be HAPPY when you start your day. Commit to put JOY in whatever comes your way. You may be hurt by what people say, but don't let anyone spoil your Day.- RVM


Even one day lost in misery is a great loss, for the day will never come back again. You lose 24 hours of happiness, joy & bliss. Live each day in happiness. - RVM


What is the Power that transcends one from Achievement to Fulfillment? The Power of Inspiration!- RVM


Your future is brighter than your past was dark.


If you aim upward, you will at shoot higher things (future prospects). If you aim downwards, you may shoot your feet (foundation).


Be the energy you want others to absorb.


Every day, live in a way that honors who you are.


Like a flower, feel yourself rise above and begin to open.


A monkey plays only with the monkeys, a donkey only enjoys the bray of the donkeys; these and other examples prove that the NATURE helps round the clock to bring & bond together automatically every living creature of the common internal features and there is absolutely no glitch possible in its working & the people can't be an exception. So rest assured, a person doesn't need to surround anyone or go around finding someone better & beautiful as everything depends purely on everyone's own nature and no one has a different associates than who s/he is as character in life i.e. a good individual gets only the good, a positive stays always with the positive and so it goes with the others.


Peace is when we look upon the world together.


Transform into your dream.


The best writers I've read possess oodles of self-doubt, yet claw their way up with each work and remain humble. Boastful ones, not so much.


The Sun, the Moon, the Stars, the Birds, the Animals, the Flowers, are all proof that a Universal Power exists. -RVM

What really got me thinking about illustrating children's books was I discovered Hugh Thompson's illustrations for

Love is written by the soul.


I soon had to admit that what I did by myself couldn't excite me, only what Lila touched became important.


Whatever you do, let it be lovely.


Love is alive when there's music in your heart.

Brent suddenly thought back to Miss Gill, the mediator in Chicago, and her saying the effects of an act traveled far beyond one's knowledge. He knew she'd meant harmful acts, like his. He saw now that the same could be said for good deeds-good, bad, and indifferent-sent a wave rolling out of sight. He wondered what his own accounting, generations later, would look like.


A good friend is a healing friend.


Your conscious thoughts are those that you are aware of. But there are deeply buried treasures to be discovered in the shadows of your subconscious brain. Your find them by closing your eyes and seeing what you can't see with your eyes wide open. To open your mind you often have to close your eyes. Shut out the world to enter a different realm.


Go for broke, my friends. Straighten your spine when you step to the podium. Trust your own tongue. Believe that your weary legs will hold you until you reach the finish line. And reach it you will if you give it your all. Fall if you must, crawl if you must, but don't you dare give up or give in until you've made it to the end. For at the end is where your great reward will be to begin anew. A new chance. A new life. A new you.


Let me be in your inspiration.


The World is Full of stupid people around you Who you wanna be

Why do you write like you're running out of time?


The tests we face in life's journey are not to reveal our weaknesses but to help us discover our inner strengths. We can only know how strong we are when we strive and thrive beyond the challenges we face.


The secret to a happiness is a small ego. And a big wallet. Good wine helps, too. But that's not really a secret, is it?


Never is a man wholly a saint or a sinner.


Others can't always define your true identity. They see what they 'want' to see but beyond your mess, God sees the beauty He created and still thinks it's good!


Frank Halford was a master at the school and remembers Adams as very tall even then, and popular. He wrote an end-of-term play when Doctor Who had just started on television. He called it 'Doctor Which.'  Many years later, Adams did write scripts for Doctor Who. He describes Halford as an inspirational teacher who is still a support. He once gave me ten out of ten for a story, which was the only time he did throughout his long school career. And even now, when I have a dark night of the soul as a writer and think that I can't do this anymore, the thing that I reach for is not the fact that I have had best-sellers or huge advances. It is the fact that Frank Halford once gave me ten out of ten, and at some fundamental level I must be able to do it.


Life is not a Race, but we still continue the Chase and try to be an Ace. It's time to get out of this Maze and Truly Live with Grace. -RVM


Your success should create a path that inspires others to follow.


There can be no belief if the things we believe in are different from the things we do.


Why did you come out when you knew how your family would react? I murmured, wrapping my arms around his waist. I brushed my lips the length of Lock's neck.

Nothing is wrong, While you are trying to achieve a goal.


It's always best to feel fulfilled first, before finding a man. Then you'll know the value of yourself, and you'll hold the key to your own happiness. So you won't turn into a vulnerable, needy, emotional mess the minute you fall in love.


Our lives reflect our inner image. If we think we're worth it, that worth will manifest in our lives. If we think we're not worthy, we'll live in lack. Believe your worth it and you will become worth it.


Regardless of your past, of your own beliefs, I promise you that you are worthy of the remarkable life you so want to live.


I promise you that the moment you unwaveringly commit to your own vision, seen and unseen powers will unite to make that vision a reality.


Dreams are blueprints and what good are blueprints until a carpenter goes to work? Dream big, and bold and brazen, but then get off your butt and do the work to realize your own dreams.


Here's the three-ingredient recipe for a glorious day: think a higher thought, move your feet forward, serve someone you've never served. Do those three things and your life will improve in a millisecond.


You must give permission for people to alter your thoughts. No matter how hard they knock, they can't get into your brain unless you open the door.


I challenge you to destroy whatever roadblock is keeping you from moving forward. Destroy it with your physical body if you must, but first, destroy it with a power greater than a nuclear bombthe power of your mind. Think it gone and it will go.


If walking into the responsibility of caring for eighteen children was difficult, walking out on that responsibility was almost impossible. The children had become a constant presence, little spinning tops that splattered joy onto everyone they bumped into.


Just because someone says that you're worthless doesn't mean its true.


We sometimes have to experience pain for us to have a story to tell. The power to heal from the pain equips us with the strength to rise up again and move beyond it all. We not only become stronger but wise enough to recognize and handle pain in the future. We however, have to learn to let the brick walls fall down so that we can experience true love once more. We must learn from pain and let it lead us to the most beautiful parts of our journey in life. Only then can our stories become fully complete.


Sometimes people claim they don't need a crutch like Jesus, but he's not a crutch, he's a teacher. If you want to be a writer, you read the classics. If you want to make great music you listen to music that's been made by great musicians who have gone before. If you're studying to be a painter, it's a good idea to study the great masters. If Picasso came into your room while you were learning to draw and said 'Hi, I have a couple of hours would you like some hints?' would you say no? So it is with spiritual masters: Jesus, Buddha or any other enlightened being. They're geniuses in the way they used their minds and hearts just as Beethoven was a genius with music, or Shakespeare a genius with words. Why not learn from them, follow their lead, study what they were doing right.



Contentment is the foundation of true Happiness. The Happiness that comes from fulfilling desires can never be permanent.
